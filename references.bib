	abstract = {In mathematics, a tensor is an algebraic object related to a vector space and its dual space that can take several different forms, for example, a scalar, a tangent vector at a point, a cotangent vector (dual vector) at a point, or a multi-linear map between vector spaces. Euclidean vectors and scalars (which are often used in elementary physics and engineering applications where general relativity is irrelevant) are the simplest tensors. While tensors are defined independent of any basis, the literature on physics often refers to them by their components in a basis related to a particular coordinate system.
An elementary example of mapping, describable as a tensor, is the dot product, which maps two vectors to a scalar. A more complex example is the Cauchy stress tensor T, which takes a directional unit vector v as input and maps it to the stress vector T(v), which is the force (per unit area) exerted by material on the negative side of the plane orthogonal to v against the material on the positive side of the plane, thus expressing a relationship between these two vectors, shown in the figure (right). The cross product, where two vectors are mapped to a third one, is strictly speaking not a tensor, because it changes its sign under those transformations that change the orientation of the coordinate system. The totally anti-symmetric symbol

            i

    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}varepsilon \_\{ijk\}\}
   nevertheless allows a convenient handling of the cross product in equally oriented three dimensional coordinate systems.
Assuming a basis of a real vector space, e.g., a coordinate frame in the ambient space, a tensor can be represented as an organized multidimensional array of numerical values with respect to this specific basis. Changing the basis transforms the values in the array in a characteristic way that allows to define tensors as objects adhering to this transformational behavior. For example, there are invariants of tensors that must be preserved under any change of the basis, thereby making only certain multidimensional arrays of numbers a tensor. Compare this to the array representing

    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}varepsilon \_\{ijk\}\}
   not being a tensor, for the sign change under transformations changing the orientation.
Because the components of vectors and their duals transform differently under the change of their dual bases, there is a covariant and/or contravariant transformation law that relates the arrays, which represent the tensor with respect to one basis and that with respect to the other one. The numbers of, respectively, vectors: n (contravariant indices) and dual vectors: m (covariant indices) in the input and output of a tensor determine the type (or valence) of the tensor, a pair of natural numbers (n, m), which determine the precise form of the transformation law. The order of a tensor is the sum of these two numbers.
The order (also degree or rank) of a tensor is thus the sum of the orders of its arguments plus the order of the resulting tensor. This is also the dimensionality of the array of numbers needed to represent the tensor with respect to a specific basis, or equivalently, the number of indices needed to label each component in that array.  For example, in a fixed basis, a standard linear map that maps a vector to a vector, is represented by a matrix (a 2-dimensional array), and therefore is a 2nd-order tensor.  A simple vector can be represented as a 1-dimensional array, and is therefore a 1st-order tensor.  Scalars are simple numbers and are thus 0th-order tensors. This way the tensor representing the scalar product, taking two vectors and resulting in a scalar has order 2 + 0 = 2, equal to the stress tensor, taking one vector and returning another 1 + 1 = 2. The

    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}varepsilon \_\{ijk\}\}
  -symbol, mapping two vectors to one vector, would have order 2 + 1 = 3.
The collection of tensors on a vector space and its dual forms a tensor algebra, which allows products of arbitrary tensors. Simple applications of tensors of order 2, which can be represented as a square matrix, can be solved by clever arrangement of transposed vectors and by applying the rules of matrix multiplication, but the tensor product should not be confused with this.
Tensors are important in physics because they provide a concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving physics problems in areas such as mechanics (stress, elasticity, fluid mechanics, moment of inertia, ...), electrodynamics (electromagnetic tensor, Maxwell tensor, permittivity, magnetic susceptibility, ...), or general relativity (stress–energy tensor, curvature tensor, ... ) and others.  In applications, it is common to study situations in which a different tensor can occur at each point of an object; for example the stress within an object may vary from one location to another. This leads to the concept of a tensor field. In some areas, tensor fields are so ubiquitous that they are simply called "tensors".
Tensors were conceived in 1900 by Tullio Levi-Civita and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, who continued the earlier work of Bernhard Riemann and Elwin Bruno Christoffel and others, as part of the absolute differential calculus.  The concept enabled an alternative formulation of the intrinsic differential geometry of a manifold in the form of the Riemann curvature tensor.},

	url = {http://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/filipovic/},
	abstract = {Topography simulations allow for a visualization of semiconductor surfaces as well as the interfaces between various material regions after a given processing step. Topography modeling of well-established processing techniques, such as material etching and deposition, has been studied for decades and very sophisticated models exist which envision the semiconductor surfaces and interfaces using the Level Set method. However, as the technology node shrinks along the predicted path of Moore's law, novel processing techniques are constantly introduced in order to enable miniaturization and to ease the financial burden of processing at these reduced nodes.

The ability to simulate semiconductor wafer topographies after the application of newly-introduced process technologies can go a long way in understanding their potential. The local anodic oxidation of silicon surfaces with an atomic force microscope (AFM) is a method which produces nanosized patterns on a silicon wafer using a localized charged needle. The technology has been developed in order to tackle the limited miniaturization potential of current photolithographic techniques. In the scope of this work, a technique which models the changing silicon topography as the silicon dioxide pattern is applied to the wafer is introduced. The topography motion is simulated using a Monte Carlo technique, whereby a particle distribution follows the surface charge density distribution. The charge density arises from the application of a strong electric field between the AFM needle tip and the silicon wafer surface.

Similarly, EEPROM memory cells can not be miniaturized further with the current processing techniques. Therefore, three-dimensional structures are being introduced in order to increase the number of available memory cells without increasing the area required. In the scope of this work, a model for Bit Cost Scalable (BiCS) memory hole etching is implemented in a Level Set framework as a combination of silicon and silicon dioxide etching steps.

A spray pyrolysis deposition model is also developed and implemented within the Level Set framework. This processing technique enables the deposition of thin films for applications such as gas sensors and solar cells. Two models for the topography modification due to spray pyrolysis deposition are presented, with an electric and a pressure atomizing nozzle. The resulting film growth is modeled as a layer by layer deposition of the individual droplets which reach the wafer surface or as a CVD-like process, depending on whether the droplets form a vapor near the interface or if they deposit a film only after surface collision.},

We demonstrate the generation of the purest microwave signal with a fractional frequency stability below 6.5 × 10−16 at 1 s and a timing noise floor below 41 zs Hz−1/2 (phase noise below −173 dBc Hz−1 for a 12 GHz carrier). This outperforms existing sources and promises a new era for state-of-the-art microwave generation. The characterization is achieved through a heterodyne cross-correlation scheme with the lowermost detection noise. This unprecedented level of purity can impact domains such as radar systems12, telecommunications13 and time–frequency metrology2,14.

Moreover, on a longer time scale, thermal drifting of the cavity resonant frequency relative to the pumping frequency causes loss of mode locking. In this Letter, an active feedback method is used both to capture specific soliton states and to stabilize the states indefinitely. The capture and stabilization method provides a reliable way to overcome thermal effects during soliton formation and to excite a desired number of circulating cavity solitons. It is also used to demonstrate a low pumping power of 22 mW for generation of microwave-repetition-rate solitons on a chip.},

Raman and his student K. S. Krishnan in liquids, and independently by Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam in crystals.
The effect had been predicted theoretically by Adolf Smekal in 1923.When photons are scattered by a material, most of them are elastically scattered (Rayleigh scattering), such that the scattered photons have the same energy (frequency and wavelength) as the incident photons but different direction. However, a small fraction of the scattered photons (approximately 1 in 10 million) are scattered inelastically, with the scattered photons having an energy different from, and usually lower than, those of the incident photons—these are Raman scattered photons. Because of conservation of energy, the material either gains or loses energy in the process.  Typically this is vibrational energy and the incident photons are of visible light, although rotational energy (if gas samples are used) and electronic energy levels (if an X-ray source is used) may also be probed. The Raman effect forms the basis for Raman spectroscopy which is used by chemists and physicists to gain information about materials.},

Second-harmonic generation of the soliton spectrum is also observed, an essential step for comb self-referencing. The Raman shock time constant of lithium niobate is also determined by measurement of soliton self-frequency-shift. Besides the considerable technical simplification provided by a self-starting soliton system, these demonstrations, together with the electro-optic and piezoelectric properties of lithium niobate, open the door to a multi-functional microcomb providing f-2f generation and fast electrical control of optical frequency and repetition rate, all of which are critical in applications including time keeping, frequency synthesis/division, spectroscopy and signal generation.},

	abstract = {Timing on a chip
Laser-induced optical frequency combs allow precision measurements and affect a broad range of technologies. Brasch et al. generated optical frequency combs on an optical chip (see the Perspective by Akhmediev and Devine). They induced an optical soliton, or optical bullet, and propagated it in an engineered microcavity waveguide. The emitted output light formed a coherent comb of frequencies spanning two-thirds of an octave. Such an on-chip demonstration bodes well for miniaturization of metrological technology and its adaption for widespread application.
Science, this issue p. 357; see also p. 340
Optical solitons are propagating pulses of light that retain their shape because nonlinearity and dispersion balance each other. In the presence of higher-order dispersion, optical solitons can emit dispersive waves via the process of soliton Cherenkov radiation. This process underlies supercontinuum generation and is of critical importance in frequency metrology. Using a continuous wave–pumped, dispersion-engineered, integrated silicon nitride microresonator, we generated continuously circulating temporal dissipative Kerr solitons. The presence of higher-order dispersion led to the emission of red-shifted soliton Cherenkov radiation. The output corresponds to a fully coherent optical frequency comb that spans two-thirds of an octave and whose phase we were able to stabilize to the sub-Hertz level. By preserving coherence over a broad spectral bandwidth, our device offers the opportunity to develop compact on-chip frequency combs for frequency metrology or spectroscopy.
A broadband and coherent frequency comb is generated with an optical microresonator. [Also see Perspective by Akhmediev and Devine]

The theory is extended to the interaction of one discrete level with two or more continua and of a set of discrete levels with one continuum.

Light detection and ranging systems are used in many engineering and environmental sensing applications. Their relatively large size and cost, however, tend to be prohibitive for general use in autonomous vehicles and drones. Suh and Vahala and Trocha et al. show that optical frequency combs generated by microresonator devices can be used for precision ranging and the tracking of fast-moving objects. The compact size of the microresonators could broaden the scope for widespread applications, providing a platform for miniaturized laser ranging systems suitable for photonic integration.
Science, this issue p. 884, p. 887
Laser-based range measurement systems are important in many application areas, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, manufacturing, formation flying of satellites, and basic science. Coherent laser ranging systems using dual-frequency combs provide an unprecedented combination of long range, high precision, and fast update rate. We report dual-comb distance measurement using chip-based soliton microcombs. A single pump laser was used to generate dual-frequency combs within a single microresonator as counterpropagating solitons. We demonstrated time-of-flight measurement with 200-nanometer precision at an averaging time of 500 milliseconds within a range ambiguity of 16 millimeters. Measurements at distances up to 25 meters with much lower precision were also performed. Our chip-based source is an important step toward miniature dual-comb laser ranging systems that are suitable for photonic integration.
Optical microresonators can be used for light detection and ranging as well as tracking fast-moving objects.

	abstract = {The dynamics of cascaded-order Brillouin lasers make them ideal for applications such as rotation sensing, highly coherent optical communications, and low-noise microwave signal synthesis. Remarkably, when implemented at the chip scale, recent experimental studies have revealed that Brillouin lasers can operate in the fundamental linewidth regime where optomechanical and quantum noise sources dominate. To explore new opportunities for enhanced performance, we formulate a simple model to describe the physics of cascaded Brillouin lasers based on the coupled mode dynamics governed by electrostriction and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. From this model, we obtain analytical formulas describing the steady-state power evolution and accompanying noise properties, including expressions for phase noise, relative-intensity noise, and power spectra for beat notes of cascaded laser orders. Our analysis reveals that cascading can enhance laser noise, resulting in a broader emission linewidth and larger intensity fluctuations with increased power. Consequently, higher-coherence laser emission can be achieved if indefinite cascading can be prevented. In addition, we derive a simple analytical expression that enables the Stokes linewidth to be obtained from spectra of beat notes between distinct cascaded laser orders and their relative powers. We validate our results using stochastic numerical simulations of the cascaded laser dynamics.},

Besides providing insights into nonlinear resonator physics, they can be applied in frequency metrology, precision clocks, and spectroscopy. Like other optical solitons, the dissipative Kerr soliton can radiate power as a dispersive wave through a process that is the optical analogue of Cherenkov radiation. Dispersive waves typically consist of an ensemble of optical modes. Here, a limiting case is studied in which the dispersive wave is concentrated into a single cavity mode. In this limit, its interaction with the soliton induces hysteresis behaviour in the soliton’s spectral and temporal properties. Also, an operating point of enhanced repetition-rate stability occurs through balance of dispersive-wave recoil and Raman-induced soliton-self-frequency shift. The single-mode dispersive wave can therefore provide quiet states of soliton comb operation useful in many applications.},

At the EP two or more eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates coalesce. Recently, it has been proposed that EPs can enhance the sensitivity of optical gyroscopes. Here we report measurement of rotation sensitivity boost by over 4X resulting from operation of a chip-based stimulated Brillouin gyroscope near an exceptional point. A second-order EP is identified in the gyroscope and originates from the dissipative coupling between the clockwise and counterclockwise lasing modes. The modes experience opposing Sagnac shifts under application of a rotation, but near the exceptional point new modal admixtures dramatically increase the Sagnac shift. Modeling confirms the measured enhancement. Besides the ability to operate an optical gyroscope with enhanced sensitivity, this result provides a new platform for study of non-Hermitian physics and nonlinear optics with precise control.},

	abstract = {Dissipative solitons can be found in a variety of systems resulting from the double balance between dispersion and nonlinearity, as well as gain and loss. Recently, they have been observed to spontaneously form in Kerr nonlinear microresonators driven by a continuous wave laser, providing a compact source of coherent optical frequency combs. As optical microresonators are commonly multimode, intermode interactions, which give rise to avoided mode crossings, frequently occur and can alter the soliton properties. Recent works have shown that avoided mode crossings cause the soliton to acquire a single-mode dispersive wave, a recoil in the spectrum, or lead to soliton decay. Here, we show that avoided mode crossings can also trigger the formation of breather solitons, solitons that undergo a periodic evolution in their amplitude and duration. This new breather soliton, referred to as an intermode breather soliton, occurs within a laser detuning range where conventionally stationary (i.e., stable) dissipative Kerr solitons are expected. We experimentally demonstrate the phenomenon in two microresonator platforms (crystalline magnesium fluoride and photonic chip-based silicon nitride microresonators) and theoretically describe the dynamics based on a pair of coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations. We show that the breathing is associated with a periodic energy exchange between the soliton and a second optical mode family, a behavior that can be modeled by a response function acting on dissipative solitons described by the Lugiato-Lefever model. The observation of breathing dynamics in the conventionally stable soliton regime is relevant to applications in metrology such as low-noise microwave generation, frequency synthesis, or spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {We propose a detailed stability analysis of the Lugiato-Lefever model for Kerr optical frequency combs in whispering-gallery-mode resonators when they are pumped in either the anomalous- or normal-dispersion regime. We analyze the spatial bifurcation structure of the stationary states depending on two parameters that are experimentally tunable; namely, the pump power and the cavity detuning. Our study demonstrates that, in both the anomalous- and normal-dispersion cases, nontrivial equilibria play an important role in this bifurcation map because their associated eigenvalues undergo critical bifurcations that are actually foreshadowing the existence of localized and extended spatial dissipative structures. The corresponding bifurcation maps are evidence of a considerable richness from a dynamical standpoint. The case of anomalous dispersion is indeed the most interesting from the theoretical point of view because of the considerable variety of dynamical behavior that can be observed. For this case we study the emergence of super- and subcritical Turing patterns (or primary combs) in the system via modulational instability. We determine the areas where bright isolated cavity solitons emerge, and we show that soliton molecules can emerge as well. Very complex temporal patterns can actually be observed in the system, where solitons (or soliton complexes) coexist with or without mutual interactions. Our investigations also unveil the mechanism leading to the phenomenon of breathing solitons. Two routes to chaos in the system are identified; namely, a route via the destabilization of a primary comb, and another via the destabilization of solitons. For the case of normal dispersion, we unveil the mechanism leading to the emergence of weakly stable Turing patterns. We demonstrate that this weak stability is justified by the distribution of stable and unstable fixed points in the parameter space (flat states). We show that dark cavity solitons can emerge in the system, and also show how these solitons can coexist in the resonator as long as they do not interact with each other. We find evidence of breather solitons in this normal dispersion regime as well. The Kerr frequency combs corresponding to all these spatial dissipative structures are analyzed in detail, along with their stability properties. A discussion is led about the possibility to gain unifying comprehension of the observed spectra from the dynamical complexity of the system.},

This work reports a soliton not previously observed in optical systems, the Stokes soliton. The Stokes soliton forms and regenerates by optimizing its Raman interaction in space and time within an optical potential well shared with another soliton. The Stokes and the initial soliton belong to distinct transverse mode families and benefit from a form of soliton trapping that is new to microcavities and soliton lasers in general.

	abstract = {Temporal dissipative solitons in a continuous-wave laser-driven nonlinear optical microresonator were observed. The solitons were generated spontaneously when the laser frequency was tuned through the effective zero detuning point of a high-Q resonance, which led to an effective red-detuned pumping. Transition to soliton states were characterized by discontinuous steps in the resonator transmission. The solitons were stable in the long term and their number could be controlled via pump-laser detuning. These observations are in agreement with numerical simulations and soliton theory. Operating in the single-soliton regime allows the continuous output coupling of a femtosecond pulse train directly from the microresonator. This approach enables ultrashort pulse syntheses in spectral regimes in which broadband laser-gain media and saturable absorbers are not available. In the frequency domain the single-soliton states correspond to low-noise optical frequency combs with smooth spectral envelopes, critical to applications in broadband spectroscopy, telecommunications, astronomy and low noise microwave generation.},

When measuring length, we learn in school that a vernier scale that uses two rulers, slightly offset, can reduce human estimation error and improve the resolution of a measurement. Yang et al. apply the same vernier principle with optical combs to develop a spectrometer that can determine the wavelength of light with high accuracy and precision. Two phase-locked counterpropagating optical microcombs generated in a miniature microresonator provided the rulers. Matching up of the “teeth” of the combs was then used to measure the wavelength of the optical light sources.
Science, this issue p. 965
Determination of laser frequency with high resolution under continuous and abrupt tuning conditions is important for sensing, spectroscopy, and communications. We show that a single microresonator provides rapid and broadband measurement of optical frequencies with a relative frequency precision comparable to that of conventional dual-frequency comb systems. Dual-locked counterpropagating solitons having slightly different repetition rates were used to implement a vernier spectrometer, which enabled characterization of laser tuning rates as high as 10 terahertz per second, broadly step-tuned lasers, multiline laser spectra, and molecular absorption lines. Besides providing a considerable technical simplification through the dual-locked solitons and enhanced capability for measurement of arbitrarily tuned sources, our results reveal possibilities for chip-scale spectrometers that exceed the performance of tabletop grating and interferometer-based devices.
Counterpropagating optical microcombs can be used as a vernier spectrometer to determine the wavelength of light.

	title = {Solitons and dynamics of frequency comb formation in optical microresonators},
	url = {https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/188349},
	abstract = {Frequency combs, that is spectra of equidistant optical lines, are powerful tools in spectroscopy
and optical frequency metrology. Conventionally, these combs are generated in mode-locked
lasers, where a train of ultra-short pulses in the temporal domain corresponds to a comb spectrum in the optical frequency domain. Recently, a novel class of frequency comb generators
was discovered based on parametric frequency conversion in Kerr-nonlinear high-Q microresonators. Here, a continuous wave pump laser is coupled to the microresonator and converted
into hundreds of comb lines via parametric four-wave mixing. These microresonator based
frequency combs are uniquely characterized by their wide mode spacing, their compactness
and their independence from broadband laser gain media or saturable absorbers. Due to their
distinct properties microresonators based combs hold promise for novel application including
spectroscopy, telecommunications, optical waveform synthesis and microwave photonics.
However, mastering the novel frequency comb technology is a challenging endeavor tightly
connected to fundamental scientific question arising from the complex nonlinear dynamics of
the system. After rapid initial progress the development of microresonator frequency combs
had come to a halt, threatened by unexplained frequency noise questioning the applicability
of microresonator based combs.
In this thesis the origin of the frequency noise is investigated based on a unique comparative
approach combining experiments in three different resonator systems namely fused silica,
magnesium fluoride and silicon nitride microresonators. Applying precision spectroscopy
and techniques of optical frequency metrology, it is revealed that the noise is due to multiple inconsistent combs forming at the same time in the microresonator. Combining the
experimental observations with a theoretical analysis we identify the ratio •/D2 of resonator
linewidth • to anomalous resonator dispersion D2 as a critical design parameter for comb
formation and hence low-noise performance of the system. For a ratio of •/D2 » 1 low noise
performance can be expected.
Having identified a regime of low noise operation, we utilize this to implement low noise
frequency combs in the mid-infrared wavelength regime, which is difficult to access with
conventional technology. The mid-infrared spectral range, also known as the ‘molecular
fingerprint’ region is of high technological and scientific importance. We employ magnesium
fluoride microresonators, which exhibit high anomalous dispersion D2 in the mid-infrared
regime such that •/D2 » 1 is achieved. We pump the microresonators with a continuous wave
laser at a wavelength of 2.5 micron derived from an optical parametric oscillator. Heterodyne
beatnote measurements with a second optical parametric oscillator confirm the low noise
ixAcknowledgements
performance. The achievement of low noise frequency comb generation in the strongly
anomalous dispersion demonstrates the potential of microresonator based combs for midinfrared applications.
Regarding the temporal domain one of the most interesting question is, whether microresonator comb generators can provide ultra-short pulses, similar to conventional frequency
combs. In this work we unveil experimentally and theoretically that this is indeed possible
and connected to the formation of temporal dissipative cavity solitons in anomalous dispersion microresonators. This constitutes the first observation of temporal, dissipative solitons
in a microresonator. The formation of solitons manifests itself as discrete state transition
of the system. The solitons form spontaneously when the pump laser is scanned through
the effective zero detuning point of a microcavity resonance into the red-detuned pumping
regime. We develop a laser-tuning method that allows to reliably generate soliton states. The
generated solitons remain stable until the pump laser is switched off. This remarkable stability
despite the usually destabilizing thermal effects under red-detuned pumping conditions is
explained. The number of solitons propagating inside the microresonator can be controlled by
the pump laser detuning. The results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations
and soliton theory. Stable long-term operation allows continuous out-coupling of a train of
femto-second pulses that corresponds to a low noise frequency comb in the spectral domain.
Combs based on solitons constitute a novel method of microresonator based comb generation,
qualitatively different from previous work. In particular, single soliton combs are characterized
by a smooth spectral envelope, which is unprecedented in microresonator based frequency
combs and essential to the envisioned application. Moreover, utilizing the ultra-short pulses
we demonstrate the generation of supercontinua extending over more than two thirds of an
octave, which could lead to so far unattained self-referencing of microresonator based combs.},

	abstract = {Controlling the interaction between localized optical and mechanical excitations has recently become possible following advances in micro- and nano-fabrication techniques. To date, most experimental studies of optomechanics have focused on measurement and control of the mechanical subsystem through its interaction with optics, and have led to the experimental demonstration of dynamical back-action cooling and optical rigidity of the mechanical system. Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also modified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to strong nonlinear effects such as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and parametric normal-mode splitting. In atomic systems, seminal experiments and proposals to slow and stop the propagation of light, and their applicability to modern optical networks, and future quantum networks, have thrust EIT to the forefront of experimental study during the last two decades. In a similar fashion, here we use the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of light via engineered photon-phonon interactions. Our results demonstrate EIT and tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal device, fabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon (Si). At low temperature (8.7 K), we show an optically-tunable delay of 50 ns with near-unity optical transparency, and superluminal light with a 1.4 microseconds signal advance. These results, while indicating significant progress towards an integrated quantum optomechanical memory, are also relevant to classical signal processing applications. Measurements at room temperature and in the analogous regime of Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA) show the utility of these chip-scale optomechanical systems for optical buffering, amplification, and filtering of microwave-over-optical signals.},

	abstract = {The coherent states that describe the classical motion of a mechanical oscillator do not have well-defined energy, but are rather quantum superpositions of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. Revealing this quantized structure is only possible with an apparatus that measures the mechanical energy with a precision greater than the energy of a single phonon, \${\textbackslash}hbar{\textbackslash}omega\_{\textbackslash}text\{m\}\$. One way to achieve this sensitivity is by engineering a strong but nonresonant interaction between the oscillator and an atom. In a system with sufficient quantum coherence, this interaction allows one to distinguish different phonon number states by resolvable differences in the atom's transition frequency. Such dispersive measurements have been studied in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics where experiments using real and artificial atoms have resolved the photon number states of cavities. Here, we report an experiment where an artificial atom senses the motional energy of a driven nanomechanical oscillator with sufficient sensitivity to resolve the quantization of its energy. To realize this, we build a hybrid platform that integrates nanomechanical piezoelectric resonators with a microwave superconducting qubit on the same chip. We excite phonons with resonant pulses of varying amplitude and probe the resulting excitation spectrum of the qubit to observe phonon-number-dependent frequency shifts \${\textbackslash}approx 5\$ times larger than the qubit linewidth. Our result demonstrates a fully integrated platform for quantum acoustics that combines large couplings, considerable coherence times, and excellent control over the mechanical mode structure. With modest experimental improvements, we expect our approach will make quantum nondemolition measurements of phonons an experimental reality, leading the way to new quantum sensors and information processing approaches that use chip-scale nanomechanical devices.},

In a fibre-based Fabry–Pérot microresonator we observe the deterministic generation of stable femtosecond dissipative cavity solitons ‘on top’ of the resonantly enhanced driving pulses. The solitons lock to the driving pulse, which enables direct all-optical control of the soliton's repetition rate and tuning of its carrier-envelope offset frequency.

With the advent of integrated photonics for complex telecommunication chips, there has been interest in the possibility of chip-scale optical gyroscopes. Besides the potential benefits of miniaturization, such solid-state systems would be robust and resistant to shock. In this thesis, we investigate a chip-based optical gyroscope using counter-propagating Brillouin lasers on a monolithic silicon chip. The near-degenerate lasers mimic a commercial ring laser gyroscope including the existence of a locking band. By using physical properties associated with the Brillouin process, a solid-state unlocking method is demonstrated. We focus on three topics to explore the potential of the counter-propagating Brillouin-laser gyroscope. First, we explore the physics of the counter-propagating Brillouin lasers by deriving the theory to link the passive cavity mode with the lasing gain medium. We explicitly show how the dispersion, Kerr nonlinearity, dissipative coupling, and Sagnac sensing affect the beating frequency of the Brillouin lasers. Second, we experimentally demonstrate the performance of the gyroscope. Most notably, the gyroscope is used to measure the rotation of the Earth, representing an important milestone for chip-scale optical gyroscopes. Third, we investigate the non-Hermitian interaction between the counter-propagating Brillouin lasers. We test the recent prediction of the EP-enhanced Sagnac effect, and observe a Sagnac scale factor boost by over 4X by measurement of rotations applied to the resonator. Our research shows the feasibility of the chip-based Brillouin laser gyroscope. This gyroscope paves the way towards an all-optical inertial guidance system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Besides a reduction of footprint, microcombs could also achieve parity with traditional frequency combs in performance by mode-locking through the formation of "light bullets" called dissipative Kerr solitons. These soliton microcombs not only serve as a unique platform to study nonlinear physics, but also offer scalable and cost-effective solutions to many groundbreaking applications, spanning spectroscopy to time standards. In this thesis I will trace the physical origin of soliton microcombs, followed by their experimental realization in high-Q silica microresonators. The impact of several nonlinear process on solitons will be discussed, which leads to novel soliton systems, e.g., Stokes solitons and counter-propagating solitons.

More recently, soliton mode-locking has made possible low-noise/reproducible generation of these miniature combs (microcombs). In this thesis, we demonstrated the generation of soliton microcombs from silica wedge disk micro-resonators and the characteristics of the soliton microcombs are described.

Also, ways to improve spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and spectral coverage are discussed. In addition to soliton microcombs, a novel spiral resonator is studied as a stable optical frequency reference. Combined with a frequency comb, this new type of chip-based reference cavity is also applied to generate stable microwaves via optical frequency division. Lastly, we generated a stimulated Brillouin laser (SBL) from the optical micro-resonator and its phonon-limited linewidth is studied.

In addition to soliton mode locking, another novel and compact platform, the electro-optical modulation frequency comb, was studied. This type of frequency comb was used to demonstrate a novel electro-optic form of frequency division for stable microwave synthesis. It was also modified to perform astronomical calibration for exoplanet detection at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The control of dispersion in fibre optical waveguides is of critical importance to optical fibre communications systems1,2 and more recently for continuum generation from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared3,4,5. The wavelength at which the group velocity dispersion crosses zero can be set by varying the fibre core diameter or index step2,6,7,8. Moreover, sophisticated methods to manipulate higher-order dispersion so as to shape and even flatten the dispersion over wide bandwidths are possible using multi-cladding fibres9,10,11. Here we introduce design and fabrication techniques that allow analogous dispersion control in chip-integrated optical microresonators, and thereby demonstrate higher-order, wide-bandwidth dispersion control over an octave of spectrum. Importantly, the fabrication method we employ for dispersion control simultaneously permits optical Q factors above 100 million, which is critical for the efficient operation of nonlinear optical oscillators. Dispersion control in high-Q systems has become of great importance in recent years with increased interest in chip-integrable optical frequency combs12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32.},

	abstract = {Ultrahigh-Q optical resonators are being studied across a wide range of fields, including quantum information, nonlinear optics, cavity optomechanics and telecommunications1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Here, we demonstrate a new resonator with a record Q-factor of 875 million for on-chip devices. The fabrication of our device avoids the requirement for a specialized processing step, which in microtoroid resonators8 has made it difficult to control their size and achieve millimetre- and centimetre-scale diameters. Attaining these sizes is important in applications such as microcombs and potentially also in rotation sensing. As an application of size control, stimulated Brillouin lasers incorporating our device are demonstrated. The resonators not only set a new benchmark for the Q-factor on a chip, but also provide, for the first time, full compatibility of this important device class with conventional semiconductor processing. This feature will greatly expand the range of possible ‘system on a chip’ functions enabled by ultrahigh-Q devices.},
