	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this project was to develop the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), a brief measure of the severity and impact of cancer-related symptoms.
METHODS: A list of symptoms was generated from symptom inventories and by panels of clinicians. Twenty-six symptoms and 6 interference items were rated by a validation sample of 527 outpatients, a sample of 30 inpatients from the blood and bone marrow transplantation service, and a cross-validation sample of 113 outpatients. Clinical judgment and statistical techniques were used to reduce the number of symptoms. Reliability, validity, and sensitivity of the MDASI were examined.
RESULTS: Cluster analysis, best subset analysis, and clinical judgment reduced the number of symptoms to a "core" list of 13 that accounted for 64\% of the variance in symptom distress. Factor analysis demonstrated a similar pattern in both outpatient samples, and two symptom factors and the interference scale were reliable. Expected differences in symptom pattern and severity were found between patients with "good" versus "poor" performance status and between patients in active therapy and patients who were seen for follow-up. Patients rated fatigue-related symptoms as the most severe. Groups of patients classified by disease or treatment had severe symptoms that were not on the "core" list.
CONCLUSIONS: The core items of the MDASI accounted for the majority of symptom distress reported by cancer patients in active treatment and those who were followed after treatment. The MDASI should prove useful for symptom surveys, clinical trials, and patient monitoring, and its format should allow Internet or telephone administration.},

Optical materials with favorable properties are essential for nanofabrication of integratedphotonics devices. Here we describe a material for integrated nonlinear photonics, tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5, hereafter tantala), which offers low intrinsic material stress, low optical loss, and efficient access to Kerr-nonlinear processes. We utilize {\textgreater}800 nm thick tantala films deposited via ion-beam sputtering on oxidized silicon wafers. The tantala films contain a low residual tensile stress of 38 MPa, and they offer a Kerr index ������������ = ������. ������(������������) × ������������"������������ m2/W, which is approximately a factor of three higher than silicon nitride. We fabricate integrated nonlinear resonators and waveguides without the cracking challenges that are prevalent in stoichiometric silicon nitride. The tantala resonators feature an optical quality factor up to ������. ������ × ������������������ , which enables us to generate ultrabroad-bandwidth Kerr-soliton frequency combs with low threshold power. Moreover, tantala waveguides enable supercontinuum generation across the near-infrared from low-energy, ultrafast seed pulses. Our work introduces a versatile material platform for integrated, low-loss nanophotonics that can be broadly applied and enable heterogeneous integration.},

Optical clocks, based on optical transitions of atoms, operate at much higher frequency than the microwave atomic clocks currently used as our timing standards. They have been shown to exhibit better stability and are poised to redefine the second. The development of stable, self-referenced optical frequency combs that span the microwave to optical wavelengths has been key to these efforts. Diddams et al. reviewed developments and refinements of these optical combs over the past 20 years and provide an overview of where they are finding application, from precision timing to high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging, ranging, and navigation.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDThe generation and control of coherent electromagnetic waves, such as those provided by electronic oscillators in the radio frequency domain or lasers in the optical domain, have had an unparalleled impact on human society over the past century. For example, precise timing with radio waves referenced to atomic transitions undergirds navigation with the Global Positioning System. And modern communication systems are built around the properties of such waves to carry data through the air or within optical fibers that circumnavigate the globe. Such technical advances rely upon an exceptionally well developed and unified theoretical understanding of radio and optical waves, as well as the devices for their generation and control. Nonetheless and surprisingly, just 20 years ago, radio and optical technology realms remained largely distinct and isolated from one another. Although light waves could be modulated at radio rates and likewise electrical currents could be produced by demodulating optical signals, a simple coherent connection between radio and optical fields did not exist. As a result, many common technologies for the synthesis and control of radio frequencies, including those central to navigation, communications, and measurement, seemed futuristic for optics. Conversely, the full potential of optics for time standards, metrology, and science was not accessible, despite a decades-long recognition of the opportunities and attempts to harness their technological impact. This situation, which arose as a consequence of the enormously high frequencies of electromagnetic waves in the optical domain, thereby limited scientific progress and technical capabilities.
ADVANCESThe invention of the laser in 1960 represented an optical analog to radio oscillators, which were invented much earlier. This development motivated efforts to create a coherent bridge between the radio and optical realms with multiple oscillators of successively higher frequencies being chained together. However, the sheer complexity and size of such approaches made it clear that these systems would never be widely available and that their capability would be limited. Such efforts were upended after nearly four decades of work when an unanticipated breakthrough enabled by combined advances in femtosecond laser technology, nonlinear optics, and precision frequency metrology finally solved this problem. The key to overcoming these issues was a new approach to generate and control the spectrum of a mode-locked laser, which was called an optical frequency comb in accordance with the regularly spaced comb of frequencies it contained. Even though mode-locked lasers and optical frequency combs had existed previously, in 2000 it was demonstrated how their spectra could be expanded over an octave of optical bandwidth. This critical advance enabled the technique of self-referencing, by which the optical frequencies of the comb are locked in an absolute sense to a radio frequency reference. In a simple and elegant way, this produced an optical clockwork, analogous to a gearbox (see the figure), that provided the bidirectional coherent connection between the optical and radio frequency domains. Moreover, because this connection is simultaneously established to many thousands of optical frequencies within the comb, self-referencing makes the coherent translation of frequencies possible across hundreds of terahertz of the optical spectrum.
OUTLOOKIn the two decades since the introduction of the frequency comb, entirely new scientific and technology vistas have been opened. New applications are leveraging an unprecedented sharing of the respective strengths of electronics and photonics, as well as a new freedom to work seamlessly across the broad optical frequency expanse. Frequency combs are used to realize and compare ultraprecise optical clocks at the 19th decimal place, which provides powerful approaches to test relativity and quantum theory as well as the search for physics beyond our present understanding. In addition, combs transfer this exceptional precision across the spectrum to perform massively parallel spectroscopy, generate the lowest-noise microwaves and few-cycle attosecond waveforms, and even help astronomers search for Earth-like exoplanets. Just as applications of frequency combs have expanded, there are new developments in frequency comb technology. Among these are combs that do not use mode locking for comb formation, as well as new approaches built on integrated photonics and microresonators that enable frequency combs on a silicon chip. Indeed, it is now clear that the once-enormous gap between optics and electronics will be further blurred as the coherent electromagnetic spectrum is united by frequency combs. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/369/6501/eaay3676/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint An optical clockwork.A frequency comb is a type of laser that functions in a manner analogous to a set of gears, as illustrated here, to link radio frequencies to a vast array of optical frequencies (“the comb”) with values precisely determined by the expression fn = nfr + f0, where fr and f0 are radio frequencies and n is an integer on the order of 105.
Optical frequency combs were introduced around 20 years ago as a laser technology that could synthesize and count the ultrafast rate of the oscillating cycles of light. Functioning in a manner analogous to a clockwork of gears, the frequency comb phase-coherently upconverts a radio frequency signal by a factor of ≈105≈105{\textless}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}≈{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}10{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}5{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msup{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater} to provide a vast array of evenly spaced optical frequencies, which is the comb for which the device is named. It also divides an optical frequency down to a radio frequency, or translates its phase to any other optical frequency across hundreds of terahertz of bandwidth. We review the historical backdrop against which this powerful tool for coherently uniting the electromagnetic spectrum developed. Advances in frequency comb functionality, physical implementation, and application are also described.},

Here, we enter the multistability regime of a Kerr microresonator to generate superpositions of distinct soliton states that are pumped at the same optical resonance, and report the discovery of heteronuclear dissipative Kerr soliton molecules. Ultrafast electrooptical sampling reveals the tightly short-range bound nature of such soliton molecules, despite comprising cavity solitons of dissimilar amplitudes, durations and carrier frequencies. Besides the significance they hold in resolving soliton dynamics in complex nonlinear systems, such heteronuclear soliton molecules yield coherent frequency combs whose unusual mode structure may find applications in metrology and spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {Free-electron beams are versatile probes of microscopic structure and composition1,2, and have revolutionized atomic-scale imaging in several fields, from solid-state physics to structural biology3. Over the past decade, the manipulation and interaction of electrons with optical fields have enabled considerable progress in imaging methods4, near-field electron acceleration5,6, and four-dimensional microscopy techniques with high temporal and spatial resolution7. However, electron beams typically couple only weakly to optical excitations, and emerging applications in electron control and sensing8–11 require large enhancements using tailored fields and interactions. Here we couple a free-electron beam to a travelling-wave resonant cavity mode. The enhanced interaction with the optical whispering-gallery modes of dielectric microresonators induces a strong phase modulation on co-propagating electrons, which leads to a spectral broadening of 700 electronvolts, corresponding to the absorption and emission of hundreds of photons. By mapping the near-field interaction with ultrashort electron pulses in space and time, we trace the lifetime of the the microresonator following a femtosecond excitation and observe the spectral response of the cavity. The natural matching of free electrons to these quintessential optical modes could enable the application of integrated photonics technology in electron microscopy, with broad implications for attosecond structuring, probing quantum emitters and possible electron–light entanglement.},

For chip-based photodetectors, two-dimensional materials bear scientifically and technologically relevant properties such as electrostatic tunability and strong light–matter interactions. However, no efficient photodetector in the telecommunication C-band has been realized with two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide materials due to their large optical bandgaps. Here we demonstrate a MoTe2-based photodetector featuring a strong photoresponse (responsivity 0.5 A W–1) operating at 1,550 nm in silicon photonics enabled by strain engineering the two-dimensional material. Non-planarized waveguide structures show a bandgap modulation of 0.2 eV, resulting in a large photoresponse in an otherwise photoinactive medium when unstrained. Unlike graphene-based photodetectors that rely on a gapless band structure, this photodetector shows an approximately 100-fold reduction in dark current, enabling an efficient noise-equivalent power of 90 pW Hz–0.5.

	abstract = {Expressions are derived for the dispersion of a laser gain medium at arbitrary values of the power density within the laser. These expressions apply to multimode operation of a laser where the mode spacing is less than the pressure-broadened atomic linewidth. The dispersion calculations are used to predict the spectra of beats between adjacent oscillating modes as a function of parameters characterizing the laser cavity and the gain medium. Experiments aimed at testing the accuracy of the threoretical predictions are described. It is shown that the theory gives a reasonably good description of the variation of the center frequency of the beat spectrum with internal power density. However, for reasonably high power densities, the observed width of the beat spectrum considerably exceeds that predicted. This discrepancy is related to an effective width of each oscillating mode.},

	abstract = {In the literature one finds several conflicting accounts of the phase difference of stimulated and spontaneous emission, as well as absorption, with respect to an existing (triggering) electromagnetic field. One of these approaches proposes that stimulated emission and absorption occur in phase and out of phase with their driving field, respectively, whereas spontaneous emission occurs under an arbitrary phase difference with respect to an existing field. It has served as a basis for explaining quantum-mechanically the laser linewidth, its narrowing by a factor of 2 around the laser threshold, as well as its broadening due to amplitude\&\#x2013;phase coupling, resulting in Henry\&\#x2019;s \&\#x03B1;-factor. Assuming the validity of Maxwell\&\#x2019;s equations, all three processes would, thus, violate the law of energy conservation. In semi-classical approaches, we investigate stimulated emission in a Fabry\&\#x2013;Perot resonator, analyze the Lorentz oscillator model, apply the Kramers\&\#x2013;Kronig relations to the complex susceptibility, understand the summation of quantized electric fields, and quantitatively interpret emission and absorption in the amplitude\&\#x2013;phase diagram. In all cases, we derive that the phase of stimulated emission is 90\&\#x00B0; in lead of the driving field, and the phase of absorption lags 90\&\#x00B0; behind the transmitted field. Also spontaneous emission must obey energy conservation, hence it occurs with 90\&\#x00B0; phase in lead of an existing field. These semi-classical findings agree with recent experimental investigations regarding the interaction of attosecond pulses with an atom, thereby questioning the physical explanation of the laser linewidth and its narrowing or broadening.},

	abstract = {The degree of spectral coherence characterizes the spectral purity of light. It can be equivalently expressed in the time domain by the decay time τ or the quality factor Q of the light-emitting oscillator, the coherence time τ coh or length λcoh of emitted light or, via Fourier transformation to the frequency domain, the linewidth Δν of emitted light. We quantify these parameters for the reference situation of a passive Fabry-Pérot resonator. We investigate its spectral line shapes, mode profiles, and Airy distributions and verify that the sum of all mode profiles generates the corresponding Airy distribution. The Fabry-Pérot resonator is described, as an oscillator, by its Lorentzian linewidth and finesse and, as a scanning spectrometer, by its Airy linewidth and finesse. Furthermore, stimulated and spontaneous emission are analyzed semi-classically by employing Maxwell’s equations and the law of energy conservation. Investigation of emission by atoms inside a Fabry-Pérot resonator, the Lorentz oscillator model, the Kramers-Kronig relations, the amplitude-phase diagram, and the summation of quantized electric fields consistently suggests that stimulated and spontaneous emission of light occur with a phase 90° in lead of the incident field. These findings question the quantum-optical picture, which proposed, firstly, that stimulated emission occurred in phase, whereas spontaneous emission occurred at an arbitrary phase angle with respect to the incident field and, secondly, that the laser linewidth were due to amplitude and phase fluctuations induced by spontaneous emission. We emphasize that the first derivation of the Schawlow-Townes laser linewidth was entirely semi-classical but included the four approximations that (i) it is a truly continuous-wave (cw) laser, (ii) it is an ideal four-level laser, (iii) its resonator exhibits no intrinsic losses, and (iv) one photon is coupled spontaneously into the lasing mode per photon-decay time τc of the resonator, independent of the pump rate. After discussing the inconsistencies of existing semi-classical and quantum-optical descriptions of the laser linewidth, we introduce the spectral-coherence factor, which quantifies spectral coherence in an active compared to its underlying passive mode, and derive semi-classically, based on the principle that the gain elongates the photon-decay time and narrows the linewidth, the fundamental linewidth of a single lasing mode. This linewidth is valid for lasers with an arbitrary energy-level system, operating below, at, or above threshold and in a cw or a transient lasing regime, with the gain being smaller, equal, or larger compared to the losses. By applying approximations (i)-(iv) we reproduce the original Schawlow-Townes equation. It provides the hitherto missing link between the description of the laser as an amplifier of spontaneous emission and the Schawlow-Townes equation. Spontaneous emission entails that in a cw lasing mode the gain is smaller than the losses. We verify that also in the quantum-optical approaches to the laser linewidth, based on the density-operator master equation, the gain is smaller than the losses. We conclude this work by presenting the derivation of the laser linewidth in a nut shell.},

Nonreciprocal devices, in which the transmission of waves is non-symmetric between two ports, are desirable for the manipulation and routing of phonons, but building acoustic non-reciprocal devices is difficult because acoustic systems typically have a linear response. Here, we report non-reciprocal transmission of microwave surface acoustic waves using a nonlinear parity–time symmetric system based on two coupled acoustic resonators in a lithium niobate platform. Owing to the strong piezoelectricity of lithium niobate, we can tune the gain, loss and nonlinearity of the system using electric circuitry. Our approach can achieve 10 dB of non-reciprocal transmission for surface acoustic waves at a frequency of 200 MHz, and we use it to demonstrate a one-way circulation of acoustic waves in cascading non-reciprocal devices.},

Breather solitons also form an important part of many different classes of nonlinear wave systems, manifesting themselves as a localized temporal structure that exhibits oscillatory behaviour. To date, the dynamics of breather solitons in microresonators remains largely unexplored, and its experimental characterization is challenging. Here we demonstrate the excitation of breather solitons in two different microresonator platforms based on silicon nitride and on silicon. We investigate the dependence of the breathing frequency on pump detuning and observe the transition from period-1 to period-2 oscillation. Our study constitutes a significant contribution to understanding the soliton dynamics within the larger context of nonlinear science.},

	abstract = {The development of inverse design, where computational optimization techniques are used to design devices based on certain speciﬁcations, has led to the discovery of many compact, nonintuitive structures with superior performance. Among various methods, large-scale, gradient-based optimization techniques have been one of the most important ways to design a structure containing a vast number of degrees of freedom. These techniques are made possible by the adjoint method, in which the gradient of an objective function with respect to all design degrees of freedom can be computed using only two full-ﬁeld simulations. However, this approach has so far mostly been applied to linear photonic devices. Here, we present an extension of this method to modeling nonlinear devices in the frequency domain, with the nonlinear response directly included in the gradient computation. As illustrations, we use the method to devise compact photonic switches in a Kerr nonlinear material, in which low-power and high-power pulses are routed in diﬀerent directions. Our technique may lead to the development of novel compact nonlinear photonic devices.},

	abstract = {While soliton microcombs offer the potential for integration of powerful frequency metrology and precision spectroscopy systems, their operation requires complex startup and feedback protocols that necessitate difficult-to-integrate optical and electrical components. Moreover, CMOS-rate microcombs, required in nearly all comb systems, have resisted integration because of their power requirements. Here, a regime for turnkey operation of soliton microcombs co-integrated with a pump laser is demonstrated and theoretically explained. Significantly, a new operating point is shown to appear from which solitons are generated through binary turn-on and turn-off of the pump laser, thereby eliminating all photonic/electronic control circuitry. These features are combined with high-Q \$Si\_3N\_4\$ resonators to fully integrate into a butterfly package microcombs with CMOS frequencies as low as 15 GHz, offering compelling advantages for high-volume production.},

Here, we break with the paradigm of the continuous-wave driving and instead use periodic, picosecond optical pulses. In a fibre-based Fabry–Pérot microresonator we observe the deterministic generation of stable femtosecond dissipative cavity solitons ‘on top’ of the resonantly enhanced driving pulses. The solitons lock to the driving pulse, which enables direct all-optical control of the soliton's repetition rate and tuning of its carrier-envelope offset frequency. When compared with continuous-wave-driven microresonators or non-resonant pulsed supercontinuum generation, this new approach is more efficient and can yield broadband frequency combs at an average driving power significantly below the continuous-wave parametric threshold. Bridging the fields of continuous-wave-driven resonant and pulse-driven non-resonant nonlinear optics, these results enable efficient microresonator frequency combs, resonant supercontinuum generation and microphotonic pulse compression.},

Here we study the influence of the microresonator mode spectrum on temporal soliton formation in a crystalline MgF2 microresonator. While an overall anomalous group velocity dispersion is required, it is found that higher order dispersion can be tolerated as long as it does not dominate the resonator’s mode structure. Avoided mode crossings induced by linear mode coupling in the resonator mode spectrum are found to prevent soliton formation when affecting resonator modes close to the pump laser frequency. The experimental observations are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations based on the nonlinear coupled mode equations. The presented results provide for the first time design criteria for the generation of temporal solitons in optical microresonators.},

	abstract = {Transparent conducting oxides have recently gained great attention as CMOS-compatible materials for applications in nanophotonics due to their low optical loss, metal-like behavior, versatile/tailorable optical properties, and established fabrication procedures. In particular, aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) is very attractive because its dielectric permittivity can be engineered over a broad range in the near-IR and IR. However, despite all these beneficial features, the slow (\&gt;100\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;ps) electron-hole recombination time typical of these compounds still represents a fundamental limitation impeding ultrafast optical modulation. Here we report the first epsilon-near-zero AZO thin films that simultaneously exhibit ultrafast carrier dynamics (excitation and recombination time below 1\&\#xA0;ps) and an outstanding reflectance modulation up to 40\% for very low pump fluence levels (\&lt;4\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;mJ/cm2) at a telecom wavelength of 1.3\&\#xA0;\&\#x3BC;m. The unique properties of the demonstrated AZO thin films are the result of a low-temperature fabrication procedure promoting deep-level defects within the film and an ultrahigh carrier concentration.},

	abstract = {Electro-optic modulators have been identified as the key drivers for optical communication and signal processing. With an ongoing miniaturization of photonic circuitries, an outstanding aim is to demonstrate an on-chip, ultra-compact, electro-optic modulator without sacrificing bandwidth and modulation strength. While silicon-based electro-optic modulators have been demonstrated, they require large device footprints of the order of millimeters as a result of weak non-linear electro-optical properties. The modulation strength can be increased by deploying a high-Q resonator, however with the trade-off of significantly sacrificing bandwidth. Furthermore, design challenges and temperature tuning limit the deployment of such resonance-based modulators. Recently, novel materials like graphene have been investigated for electro-optic modulation applications with a 0.1 dB per micrometer modulation strength, while showing an improvement over pure silicon devices, this design still requires device lengths of tens of micrometers due to the inefficient overlap between the thin graphene layer, and the optical mode of the silicon waveguide. Here we experimentally demonstrate an ultra-compact, silicon-based, electro-optic modulator with a record-high 1 dB per micrometer extinction ratio over a wide bandwidth range of 1 μm in ambient conditions. The device is based on a plasmonic metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) waveguide, which efficiently concentrates the optical modes’ electric field into a nanometer thin region comprised of an absorption coefficient-tuneable indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer. The modulation mechanism originates from electrically changing the free carrier concentration of the ITO layer which dramatically increases the loss of this MOS mode. The seamless integration of such a strong optical beam modulation into an existing silicon-on-insulator platform bears significant potential towards broadband, compact and efficient communication links and circuits.},

Such devices suffer from many drawbacks arising from the undesirable properties of their material building blocks, especially metals. There are many materials, other than conventional metallic components such as gold and silver, that exhibit metallic properties and provide advantages in device performance, design flexibility, fabrication, integration, and tunability.

Recently, an optical machine learning method based on Diffractive Deep Neural Networks (D2NNs) has been introduced to execute a function as the input light diffracts through passive layers, designed by deep learning using a computer. Here we introduce improvements to D2NNs by changing the training loss function and reducing the impact of vanishing gradients in the error back-propagation step. Using five phase-only diffractive layers, we numerically achieved a classification accuracy of 97.18\% and 89.13\% for optical recognition of handwritten digits and fashion products, respectively; using both phase and amplitude modulation (complex-valued) at each layer, our inference performance improved to 97.81\% and 89.32\%, respectively. Furthermore, we report the integration of D2NNs with electronic neural networks to create hybrid-classifiers that significantly reduce the number of input pixels into an electronic network using an ultra-compact front-end D2NN with a layer-to-layer distance of a few wavelengths, also reducing the complexity of the successive electronic network. Using a 5-layer phase-only D2NN jointly-optimized with a single fully-connected electronic layer, we achieved a classification accuracy of 98.71\% and 90.04\% for the recognition of handwritten digits and fashion products, respectively. Moreover, the input to the electronic network was compressed by {\textgreater}7.8 times down to 10x10 pixels. Beyond creating low-power and high-frame rate machine learning platforms, D2NN-based hybrid neural networks will find applications in smart optical imager and sensor design.},

Deep learning uses multilayered artificial neural networks to learn digitally from large datasets. It then performs advanced identification and classification tasks. To date, these multilayered neural networks have been implemented on a computer. Lin et al. demonstrate all-optical machine learning that uses passive optical components that can be patterned and fabricated with 3D-printing. Their hardware approach comprises stacked layers of diffractive optical elements analogous to an artificial neural network that can be trained to execute complex functions at the speed of light.

Deep learning has been transforming our ability to execute advanced inference tasks using computers. Here we introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learning–based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. We created 3D-printed D2NNs that implement classification of images of handwritten digits and fashion products, as well as the function of an imaging lens at a terahertz spectrum. Our all-optical deep learning framework can perform, at the speed of light, various complex functions that computer-based neural networks can execute; will find applications in all-optical image analysis, feature detection, and object classification; and will also enable new camera designs and optical components that perform distinctive tasks using D2NNs.

We demonstrate that extreme-ultraviolet self-torqued beams arise in high-harmonic generation driven by time-delayed pulses with different OAM. We monitor the self-torque of extreme-ultraviolet beams through their azimuthal frequency chirp.

New physics is also emerging as ultrafast tuning of metasurfaces is becoming possible, including wavelength shifts that emulate the Doppler effect, Lorentz nonreciprocity, time-reversed optical behavior, and negative refraction. The large-scale manufacturing of dynamic flat optics has the potential to revolutionize many emerging technologies that require active wavefront shaping with lightweight, compact, and power-efficient components.},

	abstract = {Optical communication systems increasingly require electro-optical modulators that deliver high modulation speeds across a large optical bandwidth with a small device footprint and a CMOS-compatible fabrication process. Although silicon photonic modulators based on transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) have shown promise for delivering on these requirements, modulation speeds to date have been limited. Here, we describe the design, fabrication, and performance of a fast, compact electroabsorption modulator based on TCOs. The modulator works by using bias voltage to increase the carrier density in the conducting oxide, which changes the permittivity and hence optical attenuation by almost 10\&\#x00A0;dB. Under bias, light is tightly confined to the conducting oxide layer through nonresonant epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) effects, which enable modulation over a broad range of wavelengths in the telecommunications band. Our approach features simple integration with passive silicon waveguides, the use of stable inorganic materials, and the ability to modulate both transverse electric and magnetic polarizations with the same device design. Using a 4-\&\#x03BC;m-long modulator and a drive voltage of 2\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;Vpp, we demonstrate digital modulation at rates of 2.5\&\#x00A0;Gb/s. We report broadband operation with a 6.5 dB extinction ratio across the 1530\&\#x2013;1590\&\#x00A0;nm band and a 10 dB insertion loss. This work verifies that high-speed ENZ devices can be created using conducting oxide materials and paves the way for additional technology development that could have a broad impact on future optical communications systems.},

	abstract = {Reactive sputter etching of SiO=, with CHF3-O{\textasciitilde} plasmas has been investigated in a parallel-plate reactor by combining etch-rate measurements with concurrent determination of ion densities (using a Langmuir probe) and the composition of neutral plasma species (using a mass spectrometer), and by examining etched profiles in the SEM. The importance of geometrical variables, such as plate separation and plate area, and the electrical parameters appropriate for characterizing the discharge are discussed. Etch rates are found to follow the ion density and to be fairly independent of the plasma chemistry under most experimental conditions. Moreover, a comparison of reactive sputter etching and reactive ion beam etching of SiO{\textasciitilde} with CHF3 and CF4 shows that etch yields per incoming ion are essentially indep e n d e n t of the flux of neutral radicals to the substrate. This strongly suggests as the d o m i n a n t etch mechanism for SiO{\textasciitilde} direct reactive ion etching, where ions themselves are the main reactants in the etch reaction. Measured etch yields are consistent with this picture. However, the plasma chemistry has a decisive influence on the etch rate of Si, and thus on the etch selectivity of SiO{\textasciitilde} with respect to Si, a n d also on the exact shape of profiles etched into SiO2.},

	abstract = {The development of integrated photonic circuits utilizing gallium phosphide requires a robust, scalable process for fabrication of GaP-on-insulator devices. Here, we present the first GaP photonic devices on SiO2. The process exploits direct wafer bonding of a GaP/AlxGa1-xP/GaP heterostructure onto a SiO2-on-Si wafer followed by the removal of the GaP substrate and the AlxGa1-xP stop layer. Photonic devices such as grating couplers, waveguides, and ring resonators are patterned by inductively coupled-plasma reactive-ion etching in the top GaP device layer. The peak coupling efficiency of the fabricated grating couplers is as high as -4.8 dB. Optical quality factors of 20 000 as well as second- and third-harmonic generation are observed with the ring resonators. Because the large bandgap of GaP provides for low two-photon absorption at telecommunication wavelengths, the high-yield fabrication of GaP-on-insulator photonic devices enabled by this work is especially interesting for applications in nanophotonics, where high quality factors or low mode volumes can produce high electric field intensities. The large bandgap also enables integrated photonic devices operating at visible wavelengths.},

However, this important theoretical prediction lacks experimental verification due to the difficulty in attaining the required nonadiabatic and large amplitude changes in the medium. Recent work has shown that in epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials it is possible to optically induce changes of the refractive index of the order of unity, in femtosecond time scales. By studying the quantum field theory of a spatially homogeneous, time-varying ENZ medium, we theoretically predict photon-pair production that is up to several orders of magnitude larger than in non-ENZ time-varying materials. We also find that while in standard materials the emission spectrum depends on the time scale of the perturbation, in ENZ materials the emission is always peaked at the ENZ wavelength. These studies pave the way to technologically feasible observation of photon-pair emission from a time-varying background with implications for quantum field theories beyond condensed matter systems and with potential applications as a new source of entangled light.},

Nonlinear optical materials can change their optical properties in the presence of light. The nonlinearity results from the constructive addition of interacting photons, but the amount of nonlinear light produced is crucially dependent on meeting strict phase-matching conditions of the interacting photon fields. Suchowski et al. (p. 1223; see the Perspective by Kauranen) now show that metamaterials can be designed with optical properties that relax the phase-matching requirements. At a specific wavelength where the metamaterial exhibits zero refractive index, the photons are found to interact nonlinearly with the phasematching done automatically.
Phase matching is a critical requirement for coherent nonlinear optical processes such as frequency conversion and parametric amplification. Phase mismatch prevents microscopic nonlinear sources from combining constructively, resulting in destructive interference and thus very low efficiency. We report the experimental demonstration of phase mismatch–free nonlinear generation in a zero-index optical metamaterial. In contrast to phase mismatch compensation techniques required in conventional nonlinear media, the zero index eliminates the need for phase matching, allowing efficient nonlinear generation in both forward and backward directions. We demonstrate phase mismatch–free nonlinear generation using intrapulse four-wave mixing, where we observed a forward-to-backward nonlinear emission ratio close to unity. The removal of phase matching in nonlinear optical metamaterials may lead to applications such as multidirectional frequency conversion and entangled photon generation.
Metamaterials relax the requirement for phase matching in nonlinear optics.

They used a wavelength regime where the permittivity of the material is close to zero and observed a large and fast nonlinear optical response.

Here, by harnessing notions from supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics, we report that the strategic coupling between a class III-V semiconductor microring laser array with its dissipative superpartner can be used to limit the number of supermodes available for laser actions to one. We introduce a novel approach based on second-order SUSY transformation in order to drastically simplify the superpartner array engineering. Compared to a conventional laser array, which has a multimode spectrum, a SUSY laser array is observed to be capable of operating in a single (transverse) supermode. Enhancement of the peak output intensity of the SUSY laser array has been demonstrated with high efficiency and lower lasing threshold, compared with a single laser and a conventional laser array.

Ideas based on topology, initially developed in mathematics to describe the properties of geometric space under deformations, are now finding application in materials, electronics, and optics. The main driver is topological protection, a property that provides stability to a system even in the presence of defects. Harari et al. outline a theoretical proposal that carries such ideas over to geometrically designed laser cavities. The lasing mode is confined to the topological edge state of the cavity structure. Bandres et al. implemented those ideas to fabricate a topological insulator laser with an array of ring resonators. The results demonstrate a powerful platform for developing new laser systems.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONTopological insulators emerged in condensed matter physics and constitute a new phase of matter, with insulating bulk and robust edge conductance that is immune to imperfections and disorder. To date, topological protection is known to be a ubiquitous phenomenon, occurring in many physical settings, ranging from photonics and cold atoms to acoustic, mechanical, and elastic systems. So far, however, most of these studies were carried out in entirely passive, linear, and conservative settings.
RATIONALEWe propose topological insulator lasers: lasers whose lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields. Extending topological physics to lasers is far from natural. In fact, lasers are built on foundations that are seemingly inconsistent with the essence of topological insulators: They require gain (and thus are non-Hermitian), they are nonlinear entities because the gain must be saturable, and they are open systems because they emit light. These properties, common to all lasers, cast major doubts on the possibility of harnessing topological features to make a topological insulator laser. Despite this common mindset, we show that the use of topological properties leads to highly efficient lasers, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at conditions high above the laser threshold.
RESULTSWe demonstrate that topological insulator lasers are theoretically possible and experimentally feasible. We consider two configurations involving planar arrays of coupled active resonators. The first is based on the Haldane model, archetypical for topological systems. The second model, geared toward experiment, constitutes an aperiodic array architecture creating an artificial magnetic field. We show that by introducing saturable gain and loss, it is possible to make these systems lase in a topological edge state. In this way, the lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport; the light propagates unidirectionally along the edges of the cavity, immune to scattering and disorder, unaffected by the shape of the edges. Moreover, we show that the underlying topological properties not only make the system robust to fabrication and operational disorder and defects, they also lead to a highly efficient single-mode lasing that remains single-mode even at gain values high above the laser threshold.The figure describes the geometry and features of a topological insulator laser based on the Haldane model while adding saturable gain, loss, and an output port. The cavity is a planar honeycomb lattice of coupled microring resonators, pumped at the perimeter with a lossy interior. We show that under these conditions, lasing occurs at the topological edge mode, which has unidirectional flux and is extended around the perimeter with almost-uniform intensity. The topological cavities exhibit higher efficiency than the trivial cavity, even under strong disorder. For the topological laser with a small gap, the topological protection holds as long as the disorder level is smaller than the gap size.
DISCUSSIONThe concept of the topological insulator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and opens exciting possibilities at the interface of topological physics and laser science, such as topologically protected transport in systems with gain. We show here that the laser system based on the archetypal Haldane model exhibits topologically protected transport, with features similar to those of its passive counterpart. This behavior means that this system is likely to have topological invariants, despite the nonhermiticity. Technologically, the topological insulator laser offers an avenue to make many semiconductor lasers operate as one single-mode high-power laser. The topological insulator laser constructed from an aperiodic array of resonators was realized experimentally in an all-dielectric platform, as described in the accompanying experimental paper by Bandres et al. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/359/6381/eaar4003/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Topological insulator laser based on the Haldane model and its efficiency.(A) Planar honeycomb lattice of coupled microring resonators pumped at the perimeter. The topological lasing mode has unidirectional flux with almost-uniform intensity, which builds up as the mode circulates and drops when passing the output coupler. (B) Slope efficiency (in arbitrary units) versus disorder strength for three cases differing only in the Haldane phase (of the next-to-nearest neighbor coupling): a topological laser with the maximum gap (blue; Haldane phase of π/2), one with a small topological gap (red; Haldane phase of π/8), and a topologically trivial laser with no gap (black; Haldane phase of 0).
Topological insulators are phases of matter characterized by topological edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make topological insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits topological effects in a unique way: the topological insulator laser. These are lasers whose lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying topological properties lead to a highly efficient laser, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The topological insulator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in topological physics, such as topologically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the topological insulator laser provides a route to arrays of semiconductor lasers that operate as one single-mode high-power laser coupled efficiently into an output port.

Wide-angle X-ray scattering is similar to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) except the distance from sample to the detector is shorter and thus diffraction maxima at larger angles are observed.

	title = {Toward non-reciprocal chip-scale silicon photonics},
	url = {http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/17422},
	abstract = {A critical problem in modern photonics is the optical isolation. An optical isolator allows light to pass through in one direction but blocks it in the other, thereby acting as the optical analogue of an electronic diode. Because such a device induces a preferred direction for light, it must break the symmetry of Maxwell's equations known as Lorentz reciprocity. This dissertation focuses on the reciprocity breaking photonic architecture that is comprised of optical modulators under prescribed driving conditions, optical delay lines and directional couplers in the silicon photonic platform. Unlike isolators based on magneto-optical Kerr effects or nonlinear effects, the author's non-reciprocal system is built by silicon photonic devices in the linear and reciprocal material platform. The system that works as the optical isolator and circulator at the same time is demonstrated by a fiber-based proof-of-concept experiment. The system architecture provides a practical answer to the challenge of non-reciprocal light routing in photonic integrated circuits (PICs). A silicon optical modulator that can satisfy the non-reciprocal system's demands is studied. The application of the PN junction's nonlinearity in the modulator can improve the robustness of the non-reciprocal system by removing the signal distortion's influence. The high-linear Mach-Zehnder modulator in silicon is also presented. The phase coherence length of the silicon photonic platform is studied to fulfill a reliable non-reciprocal system. The coherence length can quantitate the semiconductor fabrication uniformity that is critical in the design of complex PICs. A new method is proposed to analyze the random phase fluctuations from more than 800 on-chip silicon Mach-Zehnder interferometers across the wafer. For the first time, the waveguide coherence length of silicon photonic platform is extracted with statistical significance. Finally, a fabrication error model is proposed in order to effectively design the low loss compact directional coupler. High consistent performance of device is verified by experiments.},

In the context of integrated photonics, two topics with dissimilar origins—cavity optomechanics and guided wave Brillouin scattering—are rooted in the manipulation and control of the energy exchange between trapped light and mechanical modes. In this tutorial, we explore the impact of optical and mechanical subwavelength confinement on the interaction among these waves, coined as Brillouin optomechanics. At this spatial scale, optical and mechanical fields are fully vectorial and the common intuition that more intense fields lead to stronger interaction may fail. Here, we provide a thorough discussion on how the two major physical effects responsible for the Brillouin interaction—photoelastic and moving-boundary effects—interplay to foster exciting possibilities in this field. In order to stimulate beginners into this growing research field, this tutorial is accompanied by all the discussed simulation material based on a widespread commercial finite-element solver.},

Stimulated Brillouin scattering, which was recently demonstrated in silicon, is a particularly powerful approach to induce a phase shift due to its inherent flexibility, offering an optically controllable and selective phase shift. However, to date, only moderate amounts of Brillouin gain have been achieved and theoretically this would restrict the phase shift to a few tens of degrees, significantly less than the required 360\&\#x00B0;. Here, we overcome this limitation with a phase enhancement method using RF interference, showing a 360\&\#x00B0; broadband phase shifter based on Brillouin scattering in a suspended silicon waveguide. We achieve a full 360\&\#x00B0; phase shift over a bandwidth of 15\&\#x00A0;GHz using a phase enhancement factor of 25, thereby enabling a practical broadband Brillouin phase shifter for beam forming and other applications.},

To this end, the large optical nonlinearities made possible through stimulated Brillouin scattering offer a promising avenue for power-efficient all-silicon amplifiers, with recent demonstrations producing several dB of net amplification. However, scaling the degree of amplification to technologically compelling levels (\&gt;10\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;dB), necessary for everything from filtering to small signal detection, remains an important goal. Here, we significantly enhance the Brillouin amplification process by harnessing an intermodal Brillouin interaction within a multi-spatial-mode silicon racetrack resonator. Using this approach, we demonstrate more than 20\&\#x00A0;dB of net Brillouin amplification in silicon, advancing state-of-the-art performance in silicon waveguides by a factor of 30. This level of amplification is achieved with modest (\&\#x223C;15\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;mW) continuous-wave pump powers and produces low out-of-band noise. Moreover, we show that this same system behaves as a unidirectional amplifier, providing more than 28\&\#x00A0;dB of optical nonreciprocity without insertion loss in an all-silicon platform. Building on these results, this device concept opens the door to new types of all-silicon injection-locked Brillouin lasers, high-performance photonic filters, and waveguide-compatible distributed optomechanical phenomena.},

Cavity-optomechanical systems that involve two optical modes coupled to a common mechanical mode form an ideal platform to realize these effects, providing the basis for various recent demonstrations of optomechanically induced non-reciprocal light transmission. Here, we establish a unifying theoretical framework to analyze optical non-reciprocity and breaking of time-reversal symmetry in multimode optomechanical systems. We highlight two general scenarios to achieve isolation, relying on either optical or mechanical losses. Depending on the loss mechanism, our theory defines the ultimate requirements for optimal isolation and the available operational bandwidth in these systems. We also analyze the effect of sideband resolution on the performance of optomechanical isolators, highlighting the fact that non-reciprocity can be preserved even in the unresolved sideband regime. Our results provide general insights into a broad class of parametrically modulated non-reciprocal devices, paving the way towards optimal non-reciprocal systems for low-noise integrated nanophotonics.},

Here, we investigate a scheme to realize free-space isolators and highly non-reciprocal mirrors with weak modulation imparted by an acoustic wave. Conventional optical mirrors are reciprocal: in a given plane of incidence, reflection is independent of the sign of the angle of incidence, which enables two people to simultaneously look at each other through their reflection. In contrast, we propose a strategy to dramatically break this symmetry by exploiting resonant interactions between a travelling acoustic wave and highly resonant guided optical modes, inducing total reflection of an optical beam at a given angle, and no reflection at the negative angle. Different from conventional acousto-optic isolators, which are based on non-resonant frequency conversion and filtering, our proposal operates at the frequency of the optical signal by tailoring the resonant properties of the structure as well as the acoustic wave frequency and intensity, enabling 50 dB isolation with modest modulation requirements. Operation in reflection allows for close-to-zero insertion loss, enabling disruptive opportunities in our ability to control and manipulate photons.},

Rapid (for example, tens of nanoseconds) switching is achieved by an electrostatic, nanometer-scale perturbation of a thin, and thus low-mass, gold membrane that forms an air-gap hybrid photonic-plasmonic waveguide. Confinement of the plasmonic portion of the light to the variable-height air gap yields a strong opto-electro-mechanical effect, while photonic confinement of the rest of the light minimizes optical losses.

	abstract = {Boson-sampling is a simplified model for quantum computing that may hold the key to implementing the first ever post-classical quantum computer. Boson-sampling is a non-universal quantum computer that is significantly more straightforward to build than any universal quantum computer proposed so far. We begin this chapter by motivating boson-sampling and discussing the history of linear optics quantum computing. We then summarize the boson-sampling formalism, discuss what a sampling problem is, explain why boson-sampling is easier than linear optics quantum computing, and discuss the Extended Church-Turing thesis. Next, sampling with other classes of quantum optical states is analyzed. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of building a boson-sampling device using existing technology.},

We show that this system is described by an embedded Jaynes-Cummings model: in the strong coupling regime, collective spin-wave excitations of the ensemble of electrons pick up the nonlinearity of the cavity mode, such that the two lowest eigenstates of the coupled spin-wave + microwave-cavity + Josephson-junction system define a hybrid two-level system. The proposal described here enables the use of spin ensembles as qubits which can be coherently manipulated and coupled using the same nonlinear-cavity. Possibility of strong-coupling cavity-QED with magnetic-dipole transitions opens up the possibility of extending previously proposed quantum information processing protocols to spins in silicon or graphene, without the need for single-electron confinement.},

	abstract = {Recent advance of soliton microcombs has shown great promise to revolutionize many important areas such as optical communication, spectroscopic sensing, optical clock, and frequency synthesis. A largely tunable comb line spacing is crucial for the practical application of soliton microcombs, which unfortunately is challenging to realize for an on-chip monolithic microresonator. The recently discovered perfect soliton crystal (PSC) offers a convenient route to tune the comb line spacing. However, excitation of a PSC is generally stochastic by its nature and accessing a certain PSC state requires delicate tuning procedure. Here we demonstrate the on-demand generation of PSCs in a lithium niobate microresonator. The unique device characteristics allow us to produce a variety of PCSs and to switch between different PSC states, deterministically and repetitively. We utilize the device to show arbitrary dialing of the comb line spacing from 1 to 11 times of the free-spectral range of the resonator. The demonstration of PCSs on demand may now open up a great avenue for flexibly controlling the repetition rate of soliton pulses, which would significantly enhance and extend the application potential of soliton microcombs for communication, signal processing, and sensing.},

Deterministic single soliton generation is observed for microresonators with strong mode-interaction in experiments and simulations.

There has been substantial progress in realizing soliton microcombs that rely on compact laser sources, culminating in devices that only utilize a semiconductor gain chip or a self-injection-locked laser diode as the pump source. However, generating single solitons with electronically detectable repetition rates from a compact laser module has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate a current-initiated, Si3N4 chip-based, 99-GHz soliton microcomb driven directly by a compact, semiconductor-based laser. This approach does not require any complex soliton tuning techniques, and single solitons can be accessed by tuning the laser current. Further, we demonstrate a generic, simple, yet reliable, packaging technique to facilitate the fiber-chip interface, which allows building a compact soliton microcomb package that can benefit from the fiber systems operating at high power (\&gt; 100 mW). Both techniques can exert immediate impact on chip-based nonlinear photonic applications that require high input power, high output power, and interfacing chip-based devices to mature fiber systems.},

	abstract = {We provide an overview of recent experimental and theoretical developments in the area of optical discrete solitons. By nature, discrete solitons represent self-trapped wavepackets in nonlinear periodic structures and result from the interplay between lattice diffraction (or dispersion) and material nonlinearity. In optics, this class of self-localized states has been successfully observed in both one- and two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. In recent years such photonic lattices have been implemented or induced in a variety of material systems, including those with cubic (Kerr), quadratic, photorefractive, and liquid-crystal nonlinearities. In all cases the underlying periodicity or discreteness leads to altogether new families of optical solitons that have no counterpart whatsoever in continuous systems. We first review the linear properties of photonic lattices that are key in the understanding of discrete solitons. The physics and dynamics of the fundamental discrete and gap solitons are then analyzed along with those of many other exotic classes — e.g. twisted, vector and multi-band, cavity, spatio-temporal, random-phase, vortex, and non-local lattice solitons, just to mention a few. The possibility of all-optically routing optical discrete solitons in 2D and 3D periodic environments using soliton collisions is also presented. Finally, soliton formation in optical quasi-crystals and at the boundaries of waveguide array structures are discussed.},

	abstract = {Over a decade ago, an analogy was drawn between the generation of large ocean waves and the propagation of light fields in optical fibres. This analogy drove numerous experimental studies in both systems, which we review here. In optics, we focus on results arising from the use of real-t ime measurement techniques, whereas in oceanography we consider insights obtained from analysis of real-world ocean wave data and controlled experiments in wave tanks. This Review of the work in hydrodynamics includes results that support both nonlinear and linear interpretations of rogue wave formation in the ocean, and in optics, we also provide an overview of the emerging area of research applying the measurement techniques developed for the study of rogue waves to dissipative soliton systems. We discuss the insights gained from the analogy between the two systems and its limitations in modelling real-w orld ocean wave scenarios that include physical effects that go beyond a one-d imensional propagation model.},

	abstract = {Collisions between spatial solitons exhibit many interesting and diverse outputs. The largest variety of phenomena occur for a combination of saturable media and multicomponent composite (vector) solitons. Independent of the exact physical origin of the saturating nonlinearity, the phenomena are similar and exhibit universal properties. Hence photorefractive solitons, quadratic solitons, and solitons in media whose index change saturates with increasing intensity all exhibit the same interactions. In fact, interactions between any Kerr solitons also form a universal class, similar to, but reduced somewhat relative to, that of saturating nonlinearities. This similarity in interactions is likewise true for vector solitons, whose features are characterized by the composite structure, irrespective of the physical mechanism that gives rise to self-trapping. The universality manifested in the collision properties of solitons is one of their most appealing aspects. It is already clear that self-trapped wave-packets (solitons) and the de Broglie wave representation of real particles have many properties in common. Are there fundamental new laws of physics linking solitons and particles? We believe that indeed this is the case, and conjecture that in the next decade many of them will be discovered.},

The fibre is pumped in the normal dispersion regime at 708 nm and phase matching is satisfied for widely spaced parametric wavelengths of 586 and 894 nm.

Based on lectures taught by Professor Kardar at MIT, this textbook demonstrates how such theories are formulated and studied. Perturbation theory, exact solutions, renormalization groups, and other tools are employed to demonstrate the emergence of scale invariance and universality, and the non-equilibrium dynamics of interfaces and directed paths in random media are discussed.

In this Letter, we investigate how this stress impacts silica disk structures by comparison of measurements with both a finite element and an analytical model. The disk structures studied are also whispering gallery optical resonators, and proper control of stress is critical to obtain high-Q resonances. Based on our analysis, thicker oxide layers and proper control of undercut enable ultra-high-Q optical performance and mechanical stability.},

The generated state consists of more than 30,000 entangled modes arranged in a cylindrical lattice with 24 modes on the circumference, defining the input register, and a length of 1250 modes, defining the computation depth.

	abstract = {Multi-spectral frequency combs provide frontier architectures for laser standoff spectroscopy, optical clockwork, and high-capacity optical communications. Frequency microcombs, aided by their high-quality resonances and inherent third-order nonlinear susceptibility, have demonstrated remarkable impact in frequency metrology and synthesis. However, microcombs are often with limited spectral bandwidth bounded by the intrinsic second-order chromatic dispersion and the consequently low intensities at the spectral edges. To enhance the applications of frequency combs, a spectrally-broad comb generation scheme is often desired. Here we report coherent satellite clusters in multi-spectral regenerative frequency microcombs with enhanced intensities at the octave points and engineered frequency span. Beyond the conventional bandwidth of parametric oscillation, the regenerative satellites are facilitated by higher-order dispersion control allowing for multi-phase-matching in the microcavities. The frequency span of the multi-spectral regenerative satellites is deterministically controlled from 57 THz to 126 THz by pumping at C- and L- bands. We demonstrate that the regenerative satellite preserves the coherence with the central comb through the nonlinear parametric process. We further show the mirrored appearance of the satellite transition dynamics including each comb state that are simultaneously observed at the central comb. These multi-spectral regenerative satellites extend the scope of parametric-based frequency combs and provide a unique platform with wide applications.},

We observe significant reduction of sidewall roughness with our smoothing technologies, which directly results in reduced scattering losses. The rapid increase in the scattering losses as the waveguide dimension is miniaturized, as seen in conventionally fabricated waveguides, is effectively suppressed in the waveguides made with our smoothing technologies. In the oxidation smoothing case, the loss is reduced from 32 dB/cm for the conventional fabrication method to 0.8 dB/cm for the single-mode waveguide width of 0.5 μm. This is to our knowledge the smallest reported loss for a high-index-difference system such as a Si/SiO2 strip waveguide.},

Conventional LN modulators however are bulky, expensive and power hungry, and cannot meet the growing demand in modern optical data links. Chip-scale, highly integrated, LN modulators could offer solutions to this problem, yet the fabrication of low-loss devices in LN thin films has been challenging. Here we overcome this hurdle and demonstrate monolithically integrated LN electro-optic modulators that are significantly smaller and more efficient than traditional bulk LN devices, while preserving LN\&\#x2019;s excellent material properties. Our compact LN electro-optic platform consists of low-loss nanoscale LN waveguides, micro-ring resonators and miniaturized Mach-Zehnder interferometers, fabricated by directly shaping LN thin films into sub-wavelength structures. The efficient confinement of both optical and microwave fields at the nanoscale dramatically improves the device performances featuring a half-wave electro-optic modulation efficiency of 1.8 V\&\#x2219;cm while operating at data rates up to 40 Gbps. Our monolithic LN nanophotonic platform enables dense integration of high-performance active components, opening new avenues for future high-speed, low power and cost-effective communication networks.},

	abstract = {Quantum emitters are an integral component for a broad range of quantum technologies, including quantum communication, quantum repeaters, and linear optical quantum computation. Solid-state color centers are promising candidates for scalable quantum optics due to their long coherence time and small inhomogeneous broadening. However, once excited, color centers often decay through phonon-assisted processes, limiting the efficiency of single-photon generation and photon-mediated entanglement generation. Herein, we demonstrate strong enhancement of spontaneous emission rate of a single silicon-vacancy center in diamond embedded within a monolithic optical cavity, reaching a regime in which the excited-state lifetime is dominated by spontaneous emission into the cavity mode. We observe 10-fold lifetime reduction and 42-fold enhancement in emission intensity when the cavity is tuned into resonance with the optical transition of a single silicon-vacancy center, corresponding to 90\% of the excited-state energy decay occurring through spontaneous emission into the cavity mode. We also demonstrate the largest coupling strength (g/2π = 4.9 ± 0.3 GHz) and cooperativity (C = 1.4) to date for color-center-based cavity quantum electrodynamics systems, bringing the system closer to the strong coupling regime.},

	abstract = {Miniaturizing particle accelerators
Particle accelerators are usually associated with large national facilities. Because photons are able to impart momentum to electrons, there are also efforts to develop laser-based particle accelerators. Sapra et al. developed an integrated particle accelerator using photonic inverse design methods to optimize the interaction between the light and the electrons. They show that an additional kick of around 0.9 kilo–electron volts (keV) can be given to a bunch of 80-keV electrons along just 30 micrometers of a specially designed channel. Such miniaturized dielectric laser accelerators could open up particle physics to a number of scientific disciplines.
Science, this issue p. 79
Particle accelerators represent an indispensable tool in science and industry. However, the size and cost of conventional radio-frequency accelerators limit the utility and reach of this technology. Dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) provide a compact and cost-effective solution to this problem by driving accelerator nanostructures with visible or near-infrared pulsed lasers, resulting in a 104 reduction of scale. Current implementations of DLAs rely on free-space lasers directly incident on the accelerating structures, limiting the scalability and integrability of this technology. We present an experimental demonstration of a waveguide-integrated DLA that was designed using a photonic inverse-design approach. By comparing the measured electron energy spectra with particle-tracking simulations, we infer a maximum energy gain of 0.915 kilo–electron volts over 30 micrometers, corresponding to an acceleration gradient of 30.5 mega–electron volts per meter. On-chip acceleration provides the possibility for a completely integrated mega–electron volt-scale DLA.

	abstract = {Nonreciprocal devices such as isolators and circulators are key enabling technologies for communication systems, both at microwave and optical frequencies. While nonreciprocal devices based on magnetic effects are available for free-space and fibre-optic communication systems, their on-chip integration has been challenging, primarily due to the concomitant high insertion loss, weak magneto-optical effects, and material incompatibility. We show that Kerr nonlinear resonators can be used to achieve all-passive, low-loss, bias-free, broadband nonreciprocal transmission and routing for applications in photonic systems such as chip-scale LIDAR. A multi-port nonlinear Fano resonator is used as an on-chip, all-optical router for frequency comb based distance measurement. Since time-reversal symmetry imposes stringent limitations on the operating power range and transmission of a single nonlinear resonator, we implement a cascaded Fano-Lorentzian resonator system that overcomes these limitations and significantly improves the insertion loss, bandwidth and non-reciprocal power range of current state-of-the-art devices. This work provides a platform-independent design for nonreciprocal transmission and routing that are ideally suited for photonic integration.},

Most applications require a slow light waveguide design that mitigates group velocity dispersion, and efﬁcient coupling solutions over the slow light operating bandwidth. In this work, we optimize the slow-light dispersion relation of a photonic crystal waveguide with three dimensional (3D) inverse design methods. In addition, we design mode couplers to the photonic crystal waveguide. The optimized waveguide supports a slow light mode with a group index of ng = 25 and a normalized bandwidth group index product of 0.38. A compact mode coupler to a strip waveguide is designed with an average efﬁciency of 92.7\% within the slow light operating bandwidth. Lastly, we design a full etch grating which couples directly to the slow light mode with a 32.5\% average efﬁciency.},

We present an approach to continuously steer light that is based on creating a virtual frequency-gradient metasurface by combining a passive metasurface with an advanced frequency-comb source. Spatiotemporal redirection of light naturally occurs as optical phase-fronts reorient at a speed controlled by the frequency gradient across the virtual metasurface. An experimental realization of laser beam steering with a continuously changing steering angle is demonstrated with a single metasurface over an angle of 25° in just 8 picoseconds. This work can support integrated-on-chip solutions for spatiotemporal optical control, directly affecting emerging applications such as solid-state light detection and ranging (LIDAR), three-dimensional imaging, and augmented or virtual systems.},

@article{wright_mechanisms_nodate,
	title = {Mechanisms of {Spatiotemporal} {Mode}-{Locking}},
	abstract = {Mode-locking is a process in which different modes of an optical resonator establish, through nonlinear interactions, stable synchronization. This self-organization underlies light sources that enable many modern scientific applications, such as ultrafast and high-field optics and frequency combs. Despite this, mode-locking has almost exclusively referred to self-organization of light in a single dimension - time. Here we present a theoretical approach, attractor dissection, for understanding three-dimensional (3D) spatiotemporal mode-locking (STML). The key idea is to find, for each distinct type of 3D pulse, a specific, minimal reduced model, and thus to identify the important intracavity effects responsible for its formation and stability. An intuition for the results follows from the “minimum loss principle,” the idea that a laser strives to find the configuration of intracavity light that minimizes loss (maximizes gain extraction). Through this approach, we identify and explain several distinct forms of STML. These novel phases of coherent laser light have no analogues in 1D and are supported by experimental measurements of the three-dimensional field, revealing STML states comprising more than 107 cavity modes. Our results should facilitate the discovery and understanding of new higher-dimensional forms of coherent light which, in turn, may enable new applications.},

As these amplifiers offer high gain and low noise at arbitrary wavelengths with proper fiber design and pump wavelength allocation, they are also candidate enablers to increase overall wavelength-division-multiplexing system capacities similar to the more well-known Raman amplifiers. Similarities and distinctions between Raman and parametric amplifiers will also be addressed. Since the first fiber-based parametric amplifier experiments providing net continuous-wave gain in the for the optical fiber communication applications interesting 1.5- m region were only conducted about two years ago, there is reason to believe that substantial progress may be made in the future, perhaps involving “holey fibers” to further enhance the nonlinearity and thus the gain. This together with the emergence of practical and inexpensive high-power pump lasers may in many cases prove fiber-based parametric amplifiers to be a desired implementation in optical communication systems.},

Regular conductance oscillations are observed due to Fabry-Perot interference by the resonant transmission via quantized states in 1D sub-bands of the InAs nanowire. The simulated transmission of resonance tunneling matches the experimentally observed conductance oscillation patterns, implying the Fabry-Perot interference and ballistic nature of the observed electron transport.},

Two electro-optic coefficients are necessary to describe the effect in the most general plate of the crystal. The necessity for two coefficients is shown from consideration of the crystal symmetry. The behavior of Z-cut and X-cut plates are treated in detail. For Z-cut plates with the voltage in the Z direction the crystal becomes biaxial with the plane of the optic axes at 45° to the X and Y crystallographic axis. The retardation along the normal to the plate is directly proportional to the voltage and independent of the thickness. The characteristics of the polarization interference pattern for excited X and Z plates are discussed.},

We show that we can obtain 100-picojoule pulse trains at rates up to 30 gigahertz and demonstrate sub–optical cycle timing precision and useful output spectra spanning the near infrared. Our source enters the few-cycle ultrafast regime without mode locking, and its high speed provides access to nonlinear measurements and rapid transients.},

	abstract = {Phase retrieval refers to recovering a signal from its Fourier magnitude. This problem arises naturally in many scienti c applications, such as ultra-short laser pulse characterization and di raction imaging. Unfortunately, phase retrieval is ill-posed for almost all one-dimensional signals. In order to characterize a laser pulse and overcome the illposedness, it is common to use a technique called Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG). In FROG, the measured data, referred to as FROG trace, is the Fourier magnitude of the product of the underlying signal with several translated versions of itself. The FROG trace results in a system of phaseless quartic Fourier measurements. In this paper, we prove that it su ces to consider only three translations of the signal to determine almost all bandlimited signals, up to trivial ambiguities. In practice, one usually also has access to the signal's Fourier magnitude. We show that in this case only two translations su ce. Our results signi cantly improve upon earlier work.},

Our experimental results, supported by theoretical modeling, show that single solitons are easily accessible at temperatures below 60{\textasciitilde}K for the microresonator device under study. We further demonstrate that the cryogenic temperature primarily impacts the thermo-refractive coefficient. Other parameters critical to the generation of solitons, such as quality factor, dispersion, and effective nonlinearity, are unaltered. Finally, we discuss the potential improvement in thermo-refractive noise resulting from cryogenic operation.

By synchronously driving the resonator with flat-top nanosecond pulses, we can reach very large intracavity power levels, where Raman-induced soliton oscillations can be observed. We also surprisingly find that, in the limit of large cavity driving strengths, new soliton instability regimes that are not accounted for in the known bifurcation structure of driven Kerr resonators can emerge even in the absence of Raman effects.

Here we show that this Raman-induced self-frequency-shift imposes a fundamental limit on the duration and bandwidth of temporal CSs. Specifically, we theoretically predict that stimulated Raman scattering introduces a previously unidentified Hopf bifurcation that leads to destabilization of CSs at large pump-cavity detunings, limiting the range of detunings over which they can exist. We have confirmed our theoretical predictions by performing extensive experiments in synchronously driven fiber ring resonators, obtaining results in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.

Despite the success of electrostatic actuators, they suffer from trade-offs between tuning voltage, tuning range, and on-chip area. Piezoelectric actuation could resolve all these challenges. Standard materials possess piezoelectric coefficients on the order of \$\{0.01\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{nm/V\}\$, suggesting extremely small on-chip actuation using potentials on the order of one volt. Here we propose and demonstrate compact piezoelectric actuators, called nanobenders, that transduce tens of nanometers per volt. By leveraging the non-uniform electric field from submicron electrodes, we generate bending of a piezoelectric nanobeam. Combined with a sliced photonic crystal cavity to sense displacement, we show tuning of an optical resonance by \${\textbackslash}sim 5{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{nm/V\}{\textasciitilde}(\{0.6\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{THz/V\})\$ and between \$1520\$ and \$1560{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{nm\}\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim 400\$ linewidths) with only \$ \{4\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{V\}\$.

	abstract = {Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describing open systems can feature singularities called exceptional points (EPs). Resonant frequencies become strongly dependent on externally applied perturbations near an EP which has given rise to the concept of EP-enhanced sensing in photonics. However, while increased sensor responsivity has been demonstrated, it is not known if this class of sensor results in improved signal-to-noise performance. Here, enhanced responsivity of a laser gyroscope caused by operation near an EP is shown to be exactly compensated by increasing sensor noise in the form of linewidth broadening. The noise, of fundamental origin, increases according to the Petermann factor, because the mode spectrum loses the oft-assumed property of orthogonality. This occurs as system eigenvectors coalesce near the EP and a biorthogonal analysis confirms experimental observations. Besides its importance to the physics of microcavities and non-Hermitian photonics, this is the first time that fundamental sensitivity limits have been quantified in an EP sensor.},

	abstract = {Exceptional points in optics
Many complex systems operate with loss. Mathematically, these systems can be described as non-Hermitian. A property of such a system is that there can exist certain conditions—exceptional points—where gain and loss can be perfectly balanced and exotic behavior is predicted to occur. Optical systems generally possess gain and loss and so are ideal systems for exploring exceptional point physics. Miri and Alù review the topic of exceptional points in photonics and explore some of the possible exotic behavior that might be expected from engineering such systems.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDSingularities are critical points for which the behavior of a mathematical model governing a physical system is of a fundamentally different nature compared to the neighboring points. Exceptional points are spectral singularities in the parameter space of a system in which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, simultaneously coalesce. Such degeneracies are peculiar features of nonconservative systems that exchange energy with their surrounding environment. In the past two decades, there has been a growing interest in investigating such nonconservative systems, particularly in connection with the quantum mechanics notions of parity-time symmetry, after the realization that some non-Hermitian Hamiltonians exhibit entirely real spectra. Lately, non-Hermitian systems have raised considerable attention in photonics, given that optical gain and loss can be integrated as nonconservative ingredients to create artificial materials and structures with altogether new optical properties.
ADVANCESAs we introduce gain and loss in a nanophotonic system, the emergence of exceptional point singularities dramatically alters the overall response, leading to a range of exotic functionalities associated with abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum. Even though such a peculiar effect has been known theoretically for several years, its controllable realization has not been made possible until recently and with advances in exploiting gain and loss in guided-wave photonic systems. As shown in a range of recent theoretical and experimental works, this property creates opportunities for ultrasensitive measurements and for manipulating the modal content of multimode lasers. In addition, adiabatic parametric evolution around exceptional points provides interesting schemes for topological energy transfer and designing mode and polarization converters in photonics. Lately, non-Hermitian degeneracies have also been exploited for the design of laser systems, new nonlinear optics phenomena, and exotic scattering features in open systems.
OUTLOOKThus far, non-Hermitian systems have been largely disregarded owing to the dominance of the Hermitian theories in most areas of physics. Recent advances in the theory of non-Hermitian systems in connection with exceptional point singularities has revolutionized our understanding of such complex systems. In the context of optics and photonics, in particular, this topic is highly important because of the ubiquity of nonconservative elements of gain and loss. In this regard, the theoretical developments in the field of non-Hermitian physics have allowed us to revisit some of the well-established platforms with a new angle of utilizing gain and loss as new degrees of freedom, in stark contrast with the traditional approach of avoiding these elements. On the experimental front, progress in fabrication technologies has allowed for harnessing gain and loss in chip-scale photonic systems. These theoretical and experimental developments have put forward new schemes for controlling the functionality of micro- and nanophotonic devices. This is mainly based on the anomalous parameter dependence in the response of non-Hermitian systems when operating around exceptional point singularities. Such effects can have important ramifications in controlling light in new nanophotonic device designs, which are fundamentally based on engineering the interplay of coupling and dissipation and amplification mechanisms in multimode systems. Potential applications of such designs reside in coupled-cavity laser sources with better coherence properties, coupled nonlinear resonators with engineered dispersion, compact polarization and spatial mode converters, and highly efficient reconfigurable diffraction surfaces. In addition, the notion of the exceptional point provides opportunities to take advantage of the inevitable dissipation in environments such as plasmonic and semiconductor materials, which play a key role in optoelectronics. Finally, emerging platforms such as optomechanical cavities provide opportunities to investigate exceptional points and their associated phenomena in multiphysics systems. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6422/eaar7709/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Ubiquity of non-Hermitian systems, supporting exceptional points, in photonics.(A) A generic non-Hermitian optical system involving two coupled modes with different detuning, ±ω1,2, and gain-loss values, ±γ1,2, coupled at rate of μ.

Exceptional points are branch point singularities in the parameter space of a system at which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, coalesce and become degenerate. Such peculiar degeneracies are distinct features of non-Hermitian systems, which do not obey conservation laws because they exchange energy with the surrounding environment. Non-Hermiticity has been of great interest in recent years, particularly in connection with the quantum mechanical notion of parity-time symmetry, after the realization that Hamiltonians satisfying this special symmetry can exhibit entirely real spectra. These concepts have become of particular interest in photonics because optical gain and loss can be integrated and controlled with high resolution in nanoscale structures, realizing an ideal playground for non-Hermitian physics, parity-time symmetry, and exceptional points. As we control dissipation and amplification in a nanophotonic system, the emergence of exceptional point singularities dramatically alters their overall response, leading to a range of exotic optical functionalities associated with abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum. These concepts enable ultrasensitive measurements, superior manipulation of the modal content of multimode lasers, and adiabatic control of topological energy transfer for mode and polarization conversion. Non-Hermitian degeneracies have also been exploited in exotic laser systems, new nonlinear optics schemes, and exotic scattering features in open systems. Here we review the opportunities offered by exceptional point physics in photonics, discuss recent developments in theoretical and experimental research based on photonic exceptional points, and examine future opportunities in this area from basic science to applied technology.},

This model, describing a driven, detuned and damped nonlinear Schroedinger equation, gives rise to dissipative spatial and temporal solitons. Recently, the rather idealized conditions, assumed in the LLE, have materialized in the form of continuous wave driven optical microresonators, with the discovery of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS). These experiments have revealed that the LLE is a perfect and exact description of Kerr frequency combs - first observed in 2007, i.e. 20 years after the original formulation of the LLE. - and in particular describe soliton states. Observed to spontaneously form in Kerr frequency combs in crystalline microresonators in 2013, such DKS are preferred state of operation, offering coherent and broadband optical frequency combs, whose bandwidth can be extended exploiting soliton induced broadening phenomena. Combined with the ability to miniaturize and integrate on chip, microresonator based soliton Kerr frequency combs have already found applications in self-referenced frequency combs, dual-comb spectroscopy, frequency synthesis, low noise microwave generation, laser frequency ranging, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration, and have the potential to make comb technology ubiquitous. As such, pattern formation in driven, dissipative nonlinear optical systems is becoming the central Physics of soliton micro-comb technology.},

	title = {Mode-locking in an optical microresonator via soliton formation},
	abstract = {The discovery of passive mode-locking of lasers via saturable absorbers[1] has led to optical femto-second pulses with applications ranging from eye surgery to the analysis of chemical reactions on ultra-short timescales[2, 3]. In the optical frequency domain a train of such pulses corresponds to a frequency comb (equidistant optical laser lines spaced by the pulse repetition rate)[4, 5], which find use in precision spectroscopy and optical frequency metrology[6, 7]. In an alternative approach, not relying on modelocking, frequency combs can also be generated in continuously driven, Kerr-nonlinear optical microresonators via cascaded parametric four-wave mixing[8–14]. Applying a pulse-shaping mode-locking mechanism could enable compact and robust femtosecond pulse generators. However, saturable absorbers are challenging to apply to microresonators as they affect the high quality factor essential to nonlinear frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrate passive mode-locking in microresonators via soliton formation. In contrast to soliton mode-locked lasers [15] a stabilizing saturable absorber is not required due to the parametric gain mechanism. We observe the generation of pulses with 200 fs duration and low noise frequency comb spectra with low line-to-line power variation. Numerical modeling of the nonlinear coupled mode equations is used to physically understand the mode-locking and in combination with an analytical description allows the identification of mode-locked regimes. The presented results open the route towards compact, high repetition-rate femto-second sources, where the operating wavelength is not bound to the availability of laser gain media or saturable absorbers. The smooth optical soliton spectra are essential to frequency domain applications such as channel generators in advanced telecommunication or in fundamental studies such as astrophysical spectrometer calibration[12, 16–18]. Moreover, femto-second pulses in conjunction with external broadening provide a viable route to a microresonator RF-to-optical link[5, 19].},

Laser-induced optical frequency combs allow precision measurements and affect a broad range of technologies. Brasch et al. generated optical frequency combs on an optical chip (see the Perspective by Akhmediev and Devine). They induced an optical soliton, or optical bullet, and propagated it in an engineered microcavity waveguide. The emitted output light formed a coherent comb of frequencies spanning two-thirds of an octave. Such an on-chip demonstration bodes well for miniaturization of metrological technology and its adaption for widespread application.
Science, this issue p. 357; see also p. 340
Optical solitons are propagating pulses of light that retain their shape because nonlinearity and dispersion balance each other. In the presence of higher-order dispersion, optical solitons can emit dispersive waves via the process of soliton Cherenkov radiation. This process underlies supercontinuum generation and is of critical importance in frequency metrology. Using a continuous wave–pumped, dispersion-engineered, integrated silicon nitride microresonator, we generated continuously circulating temporal dissipative Kerr solitons. The presence of higher-order dispersion led to the emission of red-shifted soliton Cherenkov radiation. The output corresponds to a fully coherent optical frequency comb that spans two-thirds of an octave and whose phase we were able to stabilize to the sub-Hertz level. By preserving coherence over a broad spectral bandwidth, our device offers the opportunity to develop compact on-chip frequency combs for frequency metrology or spectroscopy.
A broadband and coherent frequency comb is generated with an optical microresonator. [Also see Perspective by Akhmediev and Devine]

The material builds on our impulse sensitivity function (ISF)-based, time-synchronous model of electrical oscillators under the influence of a periodic injection. First, we show how the accuracy of this model for LC oscillators under large injection is greatly enhanced by accounting for the injection’s effect on the oscillation amplitude. In doing so, we capture the asymmetry of the lock range as well as the distinct behaviors exhibited by different LC oscillator topologies. Existing LC oscillator injection locking and pulling theories in the literature are subsumed as special cases. Next, a transient analysis of the dynamics of injection pulling is carried out, both within and outside of the lock range. Finally, we illustrate how our framework naturally accommodates injections at superharmonic and subharmonic frequencies, leading to several design considerations for injection-locked frequency dividers (ILFDs) and the implementation of a low-power dual-modulus prescaler from an injection-locked ring oscillator. Our theoretical conclusions are supported by simulations and experimental data from a variety of LC, ring, and relaxation oscillators.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Optical Gyroscopes are among the most accurate rotation-measuring devices and are widely used for navigation and accurate compasses. With the advent of integrated photonics for complex telecommunication chips, there has been interest in the possibility of chip-scale optical gyroscopes. Besides the potential benefits of miniaturization, such solid-state systems would be robust and resistant to shock. In this thesis, we investigate a chip-based optical gyroscope using counter-propagating Brillouin lasers on a monolithic silicon chip. The near-degenerate lasers mimic a commercial ring laser gyroscope including the existence of a locking band. By using physical properties associated with the Brillouin process, a solid-state unlocking method is demonstrated. We focus on three topics to explore the potential of the counter-propagating Brillouin-laser gyroscope. First, we explore the physics of the counter-propagating Brillouin lasers by deriving the theory to link the passive cavity mode with the lasing gain medium. We explicitly show how the dispersion, Kerr nonlinearity, dissipative coupling, and Sagnac sensing affect the beating frequency of the Brillouin lasers. Second, we experimentally demonstrate the performance of the gyroscope. Most notably, the gyroscope is used to measure the rotation of the Earth, representing an important milestone for chip-scale optical gyroscopes. Third, we investigate the non-Hermitian interaction between the counter-propagating Brillouin lasers. We test the recent prediction of the EP-enhanced Sagnac effect, and observe a Sagnac scale factor boost by over 4X by measurement of rotations applied to the resonator. Our research shows the feasibility of the chip-based Brillouin laser gyroscope. This gyroscope paves the way towards an all-optical inertial guidance system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The evenly-spaced modes of an electromagnetic resonator are coupled to each other by appropriate time-modulation, leading to dynamics analogous to those of particles hopping between different sites of a lattice. This substitution of a real spatial dimension of a lattice with a "synthetic'" dimension in frequency space greatly reduces the hardware complexity of an analog quantum simulator. Complex control and read-out of a highly multi-moded structure can thus be accomplished with very few physical control lines. We demonstrate this concept with microwave photons in a superconducting transmission line resonator by modulating the system parameters at frequencies near the resonator's free spectral range and observing propagation of photon wavepackets in time domain. The linear propagation dynamics are equivalent to a tight-binding model, which we probe by measuring scattering parameters between frequency sites. We extract an approximate tight-binding dispersion relation for the synthetic lattice and initialize photon wavepackets with well-defined quasimomenta and group velocities. As an example application of this platform in simulating a physical system, we demonstrate Bloch oscillations associated with a particle in a periodic potential and subject to a constant external field. The simulated field strongly affects the photon dynamics despite photons having zero charge. Our observation of photon dynamics along a synthetic frequency dimension generalizes immediately to topological photonics and single-photon power levels, and expands the range of physical systems addressable by quantum simulation.},

We evaluate single-site resolved frequency shifts and short-term stability via self-comparison. Atom-by-atom feedback control enables direct experimental estimation of laser noise contributions. Results agree well with an ab initio Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates finite temperature, projective read-out, laser noise, and feedback dynamics. Our approach, based on a tweezer array, also suppresses interaction shifts while retaining a short dead time, all in a comparatively simple experimental setup.

	abstract = {Current single-molecule detection techniques require labeling the target molecule. We report a highly specific and sensitive optical sensor based on an ultrahigh quality (Q) factor (Q {\textgreater} 108) whispering-gallery microcavity. The silica surface is functionalized to bind the target molecule; binding is detected by a resonant wavelength shift. Single-molecule detection is confirmed by observation of single-molecule binding events that shift the resonant frequency, as well as by the statistics for these shifts over many binding events. These shifts result from a thermo-optic mechanism. Additionally, label-free, single-molecule detection of interleukin-2 was demonstrated in serum. These experiments demonstrate a dynamic range of 1012 in concentration, establishing the microcavity as a sensitive and versatile detector.
Shifts in the resonance frequency of a microcavity sensor functionalized with receptor molecules can detect the binding of a single molecule.

	abstract = {This thesis studies optical fiber taper coupled dielectric microsphere resonators and their applications. Fundamental properties including ideal coupling and critical coupling in an optical fiber taper to fused silica glass
microsphere coupling system is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. A symmetrical dual-taper coupling configuration is proposed to obtain highly efficient power transfer from the taper coupler to the microsphere resonator. Applications as channel add/drop filters and microsphere lasers are also demonstrated.
The physical essence of the fiber taper to silica microsphere is analyzed using a two-dimensional model. The relationship between the coupling strength and the
cavity loss is unveiled. Adiabatic tapers and high-quality microspheres are fabricated and used to demonstrate actual coupling systems. Perfect agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical prediction is presented.
Power transfer from the taper to a microsphere resonator has been significantly improved by employing a dual-taper symmetrically coupling configuration. Up to -28 dB extinction at the central resonant wavelength has
been measured.
We then propose a device application of the taper-sphere-taper structure as a channel add/drop filter in the wavelength division multiplexing systems. For a
filter with a bandwidth of 3.8 GHz and a dropping channel isolation of 26 dB, the bit-error-rate measurement shows no power penalty at 2.5 Gbit/s.
A 1.5 µm wavelength single-frequency fiber laser is also demonstrated using a single tapered fiber coupling to a highly doped erbium:ytterbium phosphate glass
microsphere. The fiber taper serves the dual purpose of transporting optical pump power into the sphere and extracting the resulting laser emission. As low
as 60 µW pump threshold and fiber-coupled output power as high as 3 µW with single mode operation are obtained. Imaging of photoluminescence from the sphere at visible wavelengths reveals the pump power is resonantly coupled into semiclassical orbits due to the strong absorption damping in the phosphate glass. A bi-sphere laser system consisting of two microspheres attached to a single fiber
taper is also demonstrated.
Finally, a novel hybrid fiber taper, made from a combination of a 980 nm single mode fiber and a 1550 nm single mode fiber, is proposed and demonstrated
as the micros ph ere laser coupler. Both the pump wave and laser emission are found to be more efficiently coupled to and from, respectively, the sphere modes. As high as 112 µW single-frequency laser output power is measured with a differential quantum efficiency of 12\%.},

A critical power below which stimulated effects may be neglected is defined for forward and backward Raman scattering and for backward Brillouin scattering. This critical power is determined by the effective core area A, the small signal attenuation constant of the fiber α, and the gain coefficient for the stimulated scattering process γ0, by the approximate relation Pcrit ≈ 20Aα/γ0. For a fiber with 20-dB/km attenuation and an area of 10−7 cm2Pcrit ≈ 35 mW for stimulated Brillouin scattering. For stimulated Raman scattering Pcrit is approximately two orders of magnitude higher.

However, triggering the mode-locking process is complicated by a well-known thermal hysteresis that can destabilize the solitons. Moreover, on a longer time scale, thermal drifting of the cavity resonant frequency relative to the pumping frequency causes loss of mode locking. In this Letter, an active feedback method is used both to capture specific soliton states and to stabilize the states indefinitely. The capture and stabilization method provides a reliable way to overcome thermal effects during soliton formation and to excite a desired number of circulating cavity solitons. It is also used to demonstrate a low pumping power of 22 mW for generation of microwave-repetition-rate solitons on a chip.},

	copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law#Hooke's_law_for_continuous_media},
	abstract = {Hooke's law is a law of physics that states that the force (F) needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance x scales linearly with respect to that distance. That is: 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            s
          
        
        =
        k
        x
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle F\_\{s\}=kx\}
  , where k is a constant factor characteristic of the spring: its stiffness, and x is small compared to the total possible deformation of the spring. The law is named after 17th-century British physicist Robert Hooke. He first stated the law in 1676 as a Latin anagram. He published the solution of his anagram in 1678 as: ut tensio, sic vis ("as the extension, so the force" or "the extension is proportional to the force"). Hooke states in the 1678 work that he was aware of the law already in 1660.
Hooke's equation holds (to some extent) in many other situations where an elastic body is deformed, such as wind blowing on a tall building, and a musician plucking a string of a guitar. An elastic body or material for which this equation can be assumed is said to be linear-elastic or Hookean.
Hooke's law is only a first-order linear approximation to the real response of springs and other elastic bodies to applied forces. It must eventually fail once the forces exceed some limit, since no material can be compressed beyond a certain minimum size, or stretched beyond a maximum size, without some permanent deformation or change of state. Many materials will noticeably deviate from Hooke's law well before those elastic limits are reached.
On the other hand, Hooke's law is an accurate approximation for most solid bodies, as long as the forces and deformations are small enough. For this reason, Hooke's law is extensively used in all branches of science and engineering, and is the foundation of many disciplines such as seismology, molecular mechanics and acoustics. It is also the fundamental principle behind the spring scale, the manometer, and the balance wheel of the mechanical clock.
The modern theory of elasticity generalizes Hooke's law to say that the strain (deformation) of an elastic object or material is proportional to the stress applied to it. However, since general stresses and strains may have multiple independent components, the "proportionality factor" may no longer be just a single real number, but rather a linear map (a tensor) that can be represented by a matrix of real numbers.
In this general form, Hooke's law makes it possible to deduce the relation between strain and stress for complex objects in terms of intrinsic properties of the materials it is made of. For example, one can deduce that a homogeneous rod with uniform cross section will behave like a simple spring when stretched, with a stiffness k directly proportional to its cross-section area and inversely proportional to its length.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor#As_multilinear_maps},
	abstract = {In mathematics, a tensor is an algebraic object related to a vector space and its dual space that can take several different forms, for example, a scalar, a tangent vector at a point, a cotangent vector (dual vector) at a point, or a multi-linear map between vector spaces. Euclidean vectors and scalars (which are often used in elementary physics and engineering applications where general relativity is irrelevant) are the simplest tensors. While tensors are defined independent of any basis, the literature on physics often refers to them by their components in a basis related to a particular coordinate system.
An elementary example of mapping, describable as a tensor, is the dot product, which maps two vectors to a scalar. A more complex example is the Cauchy stress tensor T, which takes a directional unit vector v as input and maps it to the stress vector T(v), which is the force (per unit area) exerted by material on the negative side of the plane orthogonal to v against the material on the positive side of the plane, thus expressing a relationship between these two vectors, shown in the figure (right). The cross product, where two vectors are mapped to a third one, is strictly speaking not a tensor, because it changes its sign under those transformations that change the orientation of the coordinate system. The totally anti-symmetric symbol 
  
    
      
        
          ε
          
            i
            j
            k
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}varepsilon \_\{ijk\}\}
   nevertheless allows a convenient handling of the cross product in equally oriented three dimensional coordinate systems.
Assuming a basis of a real vector space, e.g., a coordinate frame in the ambient space, a tensor can be represented as an organized multidimensional array of numerical values with respect to this specific basis. Changing the basis transforms the values in the array in a characteristic way that allows to define tensors as objects adhering to this transformational behavior. For example, there are invariants of tensors that must be preserved under any change of the basis, thereby making only certain multidimensional arrays of numbers a tensor. Compare this to the array representing 
  
    
      
        
          ε
          
            i
            j
            k
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}varepsilon \_\{ijk\}\}
   not being a tensor, for the sign change under transformations changing the orientation.
Because the components of vectors and their duals transform differently under the change of their dual bases, there is a covariant and/or contravariant transformation law that relates the arrays, which represent the tensor with respect to one basis and that with respect to the other one. The numbers of, respectively, vectors: n (contravariant indices) and dual vectors: m (covariant indices) in the input and output of a tensor determine the type (or valence) of the tensor, a pair of natural numbers (n, m), which determine the precise form of the transformation law. The order of a tensor is the sum of these two numbers.
The order (also degree or rank) of a tensor is thus the sum of the orders of its arguments plus the order of the resulting tensor. This is also the dimensionality of the array of numbers needed to represent the tensor with respect to a specific basis, or equivalently, the number of indices needed to label each component in that array.  For example, in a fixed basis, a standard linear map that maps a vector to a vector, is represented by a matrix (a 2-dimensional array), and therefore is a 2nd-order tensor.  A simple vector can be represented as a 1-dimensional array, and is therefore a 1st-order tensor.  Scalars are simple numbers and are thus 0th-order tensors. This way the tensor representing the scalar product, taking two vectors and resulting in a scalar has order 2 + 0 = 2, equal to the stress tensor, taking one vector and returning another 1 + 1 = 2. The 
  
    
      
        
          ε
          
            i

            k
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}varepsilon \_\{ijk\}\}
  -symbol, mapping two vectors to one vector, would have order 2 + 1 = 3.
The collection of tensors on a vector space and its dual forms a tensor algebra, which allows products of arbitrary tensors. Simple applications of tensors of order 2, which can be represented as a square matrix, can be solved by clever arrangement of transposed vectors and by applying the rules of matrix multiplication, but the tensor product should not be confused with this.
Tensors are important in physics because they provide a concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving physics problems in areas such as mechanics (stress, elasticity, fluid mechanics, moment of inertia, ...), electrodynamics (electromagnetic tensor, Maxwell tensor, permittivity, magnetic susceptibility, ...), or general relativity (stress–energy tensor, curvature tensor, ... ) and others.  In applications, it is common to study situations in which a different tensor can occur at each point of an object; for example the stress within an object may vary from one location to another. This leads to the concept of a tensor field. In some areas, tensor fields are so ubiquitous that they are simply called "tensors".
Tensors were conceived in 1900 by Tullio Levi-Civita and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, who continued the earlier work of Bernhard Riemann and Elwin Bruno Christoffel and others, as part of the absolute differential calculus.  The concept enabled an alternative formulation of the intrinsic differential geometry of a manifold in the form of the Riemann curvature tensor.},

	url = {http://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/filipovic/},
	abstract = {Topography simulations allow for a visualization of semiconductor surfaces as well as the interfaces between various material regions after a given processing step. Topography modeling of well-established processing techniques, such as material etching and deposition, has been studied for decades and very sophisticated models exist which envision the semiconductor surfaces and interfaces using the Level Set method. However, as the technology node shrinks along the predicted path of Moore's law, novel processing techniques are constantly introduced in order to enable miniaturization and to ease the financial burden of processing at these reduced nodes.

The ability to simulate semiconductor wafer topographies after the application of newly-introduced process technologies can go a long way in understanding their potential. The local anodic oxidation of silicon surfaces with an atomic force microscope (AFM) is a method which produces nanosized patterns on a silicon wafer using a localized charged needle. The technology has been developed in order to tackle the limited miniaturization potential of current photolithographic techniques. In the scope of this work, a technique which models the changing silicon topography as the silicon dioxide pattern is applied to the wafer is introduced. The topography motion is simulated using a Monte Carlo technique, whereby a particle distribution follows the surface charge density distribution. The charge density arises from the application of a strong electric field between the AFM needle tip and the silicon wafer surface.

Similarly, EEPROM memory cells can not be miniaturized further with the current processing techniques. Therefore, three-dimensional structures are being introduced in order to increase the number of available memory cells without increasing the area required. In the scope of this work, a model for Bit Cost Scalable (BiCS) memory hole etching is implemented in a Level Set framework as a combination of silicon and silicon dioxide etching steps.

A spray pyrolysis deposition model is also developed and implemented within the Level Set framework. This processing technique enables the deposition of thin films for applications such as gas sensors and solar cells. Two models for the topography modification due to spray pyrolysis deposition are presented, with an electric and a pressure atomizing nozzle. The resulting film growth is modeled as a layer by layer deposition of the individual droplets which reach the wafer surface or as a CVD-like process, depending on whether the droplets form a vapor near the interface or if they deposit a film only after surface collision.},

Past realizations, using for example coupled optical waveguides, were however limited in size and dimensionality. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate optical frequency crystals of arbitrary dimensions, formed by hundreds of coupled spectral modes within an on-chip electro-optic frequency comb. We show a direct link between the measured optical transmission spectrum and the density-of-state of frequency crystals, validated by measurements of one-, two-, three- and four-dimensional crystals with no restrictions to further expand the dimensionality. We measure signatures of quantum random walks and Bloch oscillations in the frequency domain of light in one- and two-dimensional synthetic lattices. Our work employs a quantum description of phase modulation11 to describe resonant electro-optic frequency combs, and shows that they enable the study of exotic crystal properties, topologies and quantum dynamics, while providing a versatile platform to manipulate quantum information in the optical frequency domain.},

Raman and his student K. S. Krishnan in liquids, and independently by Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam in crystals.
The effect had been predicted theoretically by Adolf Smekal in 1923.When photons are scattered by a material, most of them are elastically scattered (Rayleigh scattering), such that the scattered photons have the same energy (frequency and wavelength) as the incident photons but different direction. However, a small fraction of the scattered photons (approximately 1 in 10 million) are scattered inelastically, with the scattered photons having an energy different from, and usually lower than, those of the incident photons—these are Raman scattered photons. Because of conservation of energy, the material either gains or loses energy in the process.  Typically this is vibrational energy and the incident photons are of visible light, although rotational energy (if gas samples are used) and electronic energy levels (if an X-ray source is used) may also be probed. The Raman effect forms the basis for Raman spectroscopy which is used by chemists and physicists to gain information about materials.},

Second-harmonic generation of the soliton spectrum is also observed, an essential step for comb self-referencing. The Raman shock time constant of lithium niobate is also determined by measurement of soliton self-frequency-shift. Besides the considerable technical simplification provided by a self-starting soliton system, these demonstrations, together with the electro-optic and piezoelectric properties of lithium niobate, open the door to a multi-functional microcomb providing f-2f generation and fast electrical control of optical frequency and repetition rate, all of which are critical in applications including time keeping, frequency synthesis/division, spectroscopy and signal generation.},

	abstract = {Timing on a chip
Laser-induced optical frequency combs allow precision measurements and affect a broad range of technologies. Brasch et al. generated optical frequency combs on an optical chip (see the Perspective by Akhmediev and Devine). They induced an optical soliton, or optical bullet, and propagated it in an engineered microcavity waveguide. The emitted output light formed a coherent comb of frequencies spanning two-thirds of an octave. Such an on-chip demonstration bodes well for miniaturization of metrological technology and its adaption for widespread application.
Science, this issue p. 357; see also p. 340
Optical solitons are propagating pulses of light that retain their shape because nonlinearity and dispersion balance each other. In the presence of higher-order dispersion, optical solitons can emit dispersive waves via the process of soliton Cherenkov radiation. This process underlies supercontinuum generation and is of critical importance in frequency metrology. Using a continuous wave–pumped, dispersion-engineered, integrated silicon nitride microresonator, we generated continuously circulating temporal dissipative Kerr solitons. The presence of higher-order dispersion led to the emission of red-shifted soliton Cherenkov radiation. The output corresponds to a fully coherent optical frequency comb that spans two-thirds of an octave and whose phase we were able to stabilize to the sub-Hertz level. By preserving coherence over a broad spectral bandwidth, our device offers the opportunity to develop compact on-chip frequency combs for frequency metrology or spectroscopy.
A broadband and coherent frequency comb is generated with an optical microresonator. [Also see Perspective by Akhmediev and Devine]

	abstract = {The interference of a discrete autoionized state with a continuum gives rise to characteristically asymmetric peaks in excitation spectra. The earlier qualitative interpretation of this phenomenon is extended and revised. A theoretical formula is fitted to the shape of the 2s2p1P resonance of He observed in the inelastic scattering of electrons. The fitting determines the parameters of the 2s2p1P resonance as follows: E=60.1 ev, Γ∼0.04 ev, f∼2 to 4×10−3.

Light detection and ranging systems are used in many engineering and environmental sensing applications. Their relatively large size and cost, however, tend to be prohibitive for general use in autonomous vehicles and drones. Suh and Vahala and Trocha et al. show that optical frequency combs generated by microresonator devices can be used for precision ranging and the tracking of fast-moving objects. The compact size of the microresonators could broaden the scope for widespread applications, providing a platform for miniaturized laser ranging systems suitable for photonic integration.
Science, this issue p. 884, p. 887
Laser-based range measurement systems are important in many application areas, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, manufacturing, formation flying of satellites, and basic science. Coherent laser ranging systems using dual-frequency combs provide an unprecedented combination of long range, high precision, and fast update rate. We report dual-comb distance measurement using chip-based soliton microcombs. A single pump laser was used to generate dual-frequency combs within a single microresonator as counterpropagating solitons. We demonstrated time-of-flight measurement with 200-nanometer precision at an averaging time of 500 milliseconds within a range ambiguity of 16 millimeters. Measurements at distances up to 25 meters with much lower precision were also performed. Our chip-based source is an important step toward miniature dual-comb laser ranging systems that are suitable for photonic integration.
Optical microresonators can be used for light detection and ranging as well as tracking fast-moving objects.

	abstract = {The dynamics of cascaded-order Brillouin lasers make them ideal for applications such as rotation sensing, highly coherent optical communications, and low-noise microwave signal synthesis. Remarkably, when implemented at the chip scale, recent experimental studies have revealed that Brillouin lasers can operate in the fundamental linewidth regime where optomechanical and quantum noise sources dominate. To explore new opportunities for enhanced performance, we formulate a simple model to describe the physics of cascaded Brillouin lasers based on the coupled mode dynamics governed by electrostriction and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. From this model, we obtain analytical formulas describing the steady-state power evolution and accompanying noise properties, including expressions for phase noise, relative-intensity noise, and power spectra for beat notes of cascaded laser orders. Our analysis reveals that cascading can enhance laser noise, resulting in a broader emission linewidth and larger intensity fluctuations with increased power. Consequently, higher-coherence laser emission can be achieved if indefinite cascading can be prevented. In addition, we derive a simple analytical expression that enables the Stokes linewidth to be obtained from spectra of beat notes between distinct cascaded laser orders and their relative powers. We validate our results using stochastic numerical simulations of the cascaded laser dynamics.},

Besides providing insights into nonlinear resonator physics, they can be applied in frequency metrology, precision clocks, and spectroscopy. Like other optical solitons, the dissipative Kerr soliton can radiate power as a dispersive wave through a process that is the optical analogue of Cherenkov radiation. Dispersive waves typically consist of an ensemble of optical modes. Here, a limiting case is studied in which the dispersive wave is concentrated into a single cavity mode. In this limit, its interaction with the soliton induces hysteresis behaviour in the soliton’s spectral and temporal properties. Also, an operating point of enhanced repetition-rate stability occurs through balance of dispersive-wave recoil and Raman-induced soliton-self-frequency shift. The single-mode dispersive wave can therefore provide quiet states of soliton comb operation useful in many applications.},

At the EP two or more eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates coalesce. Recently, it has been proposed that EPs can enhance the sensitivity of optical gyroscopes. Here we report measurement of rotation sensitivity boost by over 4X resulting from operation of a chip-based stimulated Brillouin gyroscope near an exceptional point. A second-order EP is identified in the gyroscope and originates from the dissipative coupling between the clockwise and counterclockwise lasing modes. The modes experience opposing Sagnac shifts under application of a rotation, but near the exceptional point new modal admixtures dramatically increase the Sagnac shift. Modeling confirms the measured enhancement. Besides the ability to operate an optical gyroscope with enhanced sensitivity, this result provides a new platform for study of non-Hermitian physics and nonlinear optics with precise control.},

	abstract = {Dissipative solitons can be found in a variety of systems resulting from the double balance between dispersion and nonlinearity, as well as gain and loss. Recently, they have been observed to spontaneously form in Kerr nonlinear microresonators driven by a continuous wave laser, providing a compact source of coherent optical frequency combs. As optical microresonators are commonly multimode, intermode interactions, which give rise to avoided mode crossings, frequently occur and can alter the soliton properties. Recent works have shown that avoided mode crossings cause the soliton to acquire a single-mode dispersive wave, a recoil in the spectrum, or lead to soliton decay. Here, we show that avoided mode crossings can also trigger the formation of breather solitons, solitons that undergo a periodic evolution in their amplitude and duration. This new breather soliton, referred to as an intermode breather soliton, occurs within a laser detuning range where conventionally stationary (i.e., stable) dissipative Kerr solitons are expected. We experimentally demonstrate the phenomenon in two microresonator platforms (crystalline magnesium fluoride and photonic chip-based silicon nitride microresonators) and theoretically describe the dynamics based on a pair of coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations. We show that the breathing is associated with a periodic energy exchange between the soliton and a second optical mode family, a behavior that can be modeled by a response function acting on dissipative solitons described by the Lugiato-Lefever model. The observation of breathing dynamics in the conventionally stable soliton regime is relevant to applications in metrology such as low-noise microwave generation, frequency synthesis, or spectroscopy.},

We analyze the spatial bifurcation structure of the stationary states depending on two parameters that are experimentally tunable; namely, the pump power and the cavity detuning. Our study demonstrates that, in both the anomalous- and normal-dispersion cases, nontrivial equilibria play an important role in this bifurcation map because their associated eigenvalues undergo critical bifurcations that are actually foreshadowing the existence of localized and extended spatial dissipative structures. The corresponding bifurcation maps are evidence of a considerable richness from a dynamical standpoint. The case of anomalous dispersion is indeed the most interesting from the theoretical point of view because of the considerable variety of dynamical behavior that can be observed. For this case we study the emergence of super- and subcritical Turing patterns (or primary combs) in the system via modulational instability. We determine the areas where bright isolated cavity solitons emerge, and we show that soliton molecules can emerge as well. Very complex temporal patterns can actually be observed in the system, where solitons (or soliton complexes) coexist with or without mutual interactions. Our investigations also unveil the mechanism leading to the phenomenon of breathing solitons. Two routes to chaos in the system are identified; namely, a route via the destabilization of a primary comb, and another via the destabilization of solitons. For the case of normal dispersion, we unveil the mechanism leading to the emergence of weakly stable Turing patterns. We demonstrate that this weak stability is justified by the distribution of stable and unstable fixed points in the parameter space (flat states). We show that dark cavity solitons can emerge in the system, and also show how these solitons can coexist in the resonator as long as they do not interact with each other. We find evidence of breather solitons in this normal dispersion regime as well. The Kerr frequency combs corresponding to all these spatial dissipative structures are analyzed in detail, along with their stability properties. A discussion is led about the possibility to gain unifying comprehension of the observed spectra from the dynamical complexity of the system.},

They are studied in many fields, but are especially well known in optics on account of the relative ease of their formation and control in optical fibre waveguides1,2. Besides their many interesting properties, solitons are important to optical continuum generation3, in mode-locked lasers4,5, and have been considered as a natural way to convey data over great distances6. Recently, solitons have been realized in microcavities7, thereby bringing the power of microfabrication methods to future applications. This work reports a soliton not previously observed in optical systems, the Stokes soliton. The Stokes soliton forms and regenerates by optimizing its Raman interaction in space and time within an optical potential well shared with another soliton. The Stokes and the initial soliton belong to distinct transverse mode families and benefit from a form of soliton trapping that is new to microcavities and soliton lasers in general. The discovery of a new optical soliton can impact work in other areas of photonics, including nonlinear optics and spectroscopy.},

When measuring length, we learn in school that a vernier scale that uses two rulers, slightly offset, can reduce human estimation error and improve the resolution of a measurement. Yang et al. apply the same vernier principle with optical combs to develop a spectrometer that can determine the wavelength of light with high accuracy and precision. Two phase-locked counterpropagating optical microcombs generated in a miniature microresonator provided the rulers. Matching up of the “teeth” of the combs was then used to measure the wavelength of the optical light sources.
Science, this issue p. 965
Determination of laser frequency with high resolution under continuous and abrupt tuning conditions is important for sensing, spectroscopy, and communications. We show that a single microresonator provides rapid and broadband measurement of optical frequencies with a relative frequency precision comparable to that of conventional dual-frequency comb systems. Dual-locked counterpropagating solitons having slightly different repetition rates were used to implement a vernier spectrometer, which enabled characterization of laser tuning rates as high as 10 terahertz per second, broadly step-tuned lasers, multiline laser spectra, and molecular absorption lines. Besides providing a considerable technical simplification through the dual-locked solitons and enhanced capability for measurement of arbitrarily tuned sources, our results reveal possibilities for chip-scale spectrometers that exceed the performance of tabletop grating and interferometer-based devices.
Counterpropagating optical microcombs can be used as a vernier spectrometer to determine the wavelength of light.

	title = {Solitons and dynamics of frequency comb formation in optical microresonators},
	url = {https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/188349},
	abstract = {Frequency combs, that is spectra of equidistant optical lines, are powerful tools in spectroscopy
and optical frequency metrology. Conventionally, these combs are generated in mode-locked
lasers, where a train of ultra-short pulses in the temporal domain corresponds to a comb spectrum in the optical frequency domain. Recently, a novel class of frequency comb generators
was discovered based on parametric frequency conversion in Kerr-nonlinear high-Q microresonators. Here, a continuous wave pump laser is coupled to the microresonator and converted
into hundreds of comb lines via parametric four-wave mixing. These microresonator based
frequency combs are uniquely characterized by their wide mode spacing, their compactness
and their independence from broadband laser gain media or saturable absorbers. Due to their
distinct properties microresonators based combs hold promise for novel application including
spectroscopy, telecommunications, optical waveform synthesis and microwave photonics.
However, mastering the novel frequency comb technology is a challenging endeavor tightly
connected to fundamental scientific question arising from the complex nonlinear dynamics of
the system. After rapid initial progress the development of microresonator frequency combs
had come to a halt, threatened by unexplained frequency noise questioning the applicability
of microresonator based combs.
In this thesis the origin of the frequency noise is investigated based on a unique comparative
approach combining experiments in three different resonator systems namely fused silica,
magnesium fluoride and silicon nitride microresonators. Applying precision spectroscopy
and techniques of optical frequency metrology, it is revealed that the noise is due to multiple inconsistent combs forming at the same time in the microresonator. Combining the
experimental observations with a theoretical analysis we identify the ratio •/D2 of resonator
linewidth • to anomalous resonator dispersion D2 as a critical design parameter for comb
formation and hence low-noise performance of the system. For a ratio of •/D2 » 1 low noise
performance can be expected.
Having identified a regime of low noise operation, we utilize this to implement low noise
frequency combs in the mid-infrared wavelength regime, which is difficult to access with
conventional technology. The mid-infrared spectral range, also known as the ‘molecular
fingerprint’ region is of high technological and scientific importance. We employ magnesium
fluoride microresonators, which exhibit high anomalous dispersion D2 in the mid-infrared
regime such that •/D2 » 1 is achieved. We pump the microresonators with a continuous wave
laser at a wavelength of 2.5 micron derived from an optical parametric oscillator. Heterodyne
beatnote measurements with a second optical parametric oscillator confirm the low noise
ixAcknowledgements
performance. The achievement of low noise frequency comb generation in the strongly
anomalous dispersion demonstrates the potential of microresonator based combs for midinfrared applications.
Regarding the temporal domain one of the most interesting question is, whether microresonator comb generators can provide ultra-short pulses, similar to conventional frequency
combs. In this work we unveil experimentally and theoretically that this is indeed possible
and connected to the formation of temporal dissipative cavity solitons in anomalous dispersion microresonators. This constitutes the first observation of temporal, dissipative solitons
in a microresonator. The formation of solitons manifests itself as discrete state transition
of the system. The solitons form spontaneously when the pump laser is scanned through
the effective zero detuning point of a microcavity resonance into the red-detuned pumping
regime. We develop a laser-tuning method that allows to reliably generate soliton states. The
generated solitons remain stable until the pump laser is switched off. This remarkable stability
despite the usually destabilizing thermal effects under red-detuned pumping conditions is
explained. The number of solitons propagating inside the microresonator can be controlled by
the pump laser detuning. The results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations
and soliton theory. Stable long-term operation allows continuous out-coupling of a train of
femto-second pulses that corresponds to a low noise frequency comb in the spectral domain.
Combs based on solitons constitute a novel method of microresonator based comb generation,
qualitatively different from previous work. In particular, single soliton combs are characterized
by a smooth spectral envelope, which is unprecedented in microresonator based frequency
combs and essential to the envisioned application. Moreover, utilizing the ultra-short pulses
we demonstrate the generation of supercontinua extending over more than two thirds of an
octave, which could lead to so far unattained self-referencing of microresonator based combs.},

	abstract = {Controlling the interaction between localized optical and mechanical excitations has recently become possible following advances in micro- and nano-fabrication techniques. To date, most experimental studies of optomechanics have focused on measurement and control of the mechanical subsystem through its interaction with optics, and have led to the experimental demonstration of dynamical back-action cooling and optical rigidity of the mechanical system. Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also modified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to strong nonlinear effects such as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and parametric normal-mode splitting. In atomic systems, seminal experiments and proposals to slow and stop the propagation of light, and their applicability to modern optical networks, and future quantum networks, have thrust EIT to the forefront of experimental study during the last two decades. In a similar fashion, here we use the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of light via engineered photon-phonon interactions. Our results demonstrate EIT and tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal device, fabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon (Si). At low temperature (8.7 K), we show an optically-tunable delay of 50 ns with near-unity optical transparency, and superluminal light with a 1.4 microseconds signal advance. These results, while indicating significant progress towards an integrated quantum optomechanical memory, are also relevant to classical signal processing applications. Measurements at room temperature and in the analogous regime of Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA) show the utility of these chip-scale optomechanical systems for optical buffering, amplification, and filtering of microwave-over-optical signals.},

	abstract = {The coherent states that describe the classical motion of a mechanical oscillator do not have well-defined energy, but are rather quantum superpositions of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. Revealing this quantized structure is only possible with an apparatus that measures the mechanical energy with a precision greater than the energy of a single phonon, \${\textbackslash}hbar{\textbackslash}omega\_{\textbackslash}text\{m\}\$. One way to achieve this sensitivity is by engineering a strong but nonresonant interaction between the oscillator and an atom. In a system with sufficient quantum coherence, this interaction allows one to distinguish different phonon number states by resolvable differences in the atom's transition frequency. Such dispersive measurements have been studied in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics where experiments using real and artificial atoms have resolved the photon number states of cavities. Here, we report an experiment where an artificial atom senses the motional energy of a driven nanomechanical oscillator with sufficient sensitivity to resolve the quantization of its energy. To realize this, we build a hybrid platform that integrates nanomechanical piezoelectric resonators with a microwave superconducting qubit on the same chip. We excite phonons with resonant pulses of varying amplitude and probe the resulting excitation spectrum of the qubit to observe phonon-number-dependent frequency shifts \${\textbackslash}approx 5\$ times larger than the qubit linewidth. Our result demonstrates a fully integrated platform for quantum acoustics that combines large couplings, considerable coherence times, and excellent control over the mechanical mode structure. With modest experimental improvements, we expect our approach will make quantum nondemolition measurements of phonons an experimental reality, leading the way to new quantum sensors and information processing approaches that use chip-scale nanomechanical devices.},

Used to rely on table-top mode-locked lasers, optical frequency combs have been recently realized in a miniaturized form, namely the microcomb, using monolithic microresonators. Besides a reduction of footprint, microcombs could also achieve parity with traditional frequency combs in performance by mode-locking through the formation of "light bullets" called dissipative Kerr solitons. These soliton microcombs not only serve as a unique platform to study nonlinear physics, but also offer scalable and cost-effective solutions to many groundbreaking applications, spanning spectroscopy to time standards. In this thesis I will trace the physical origin of soliton microcombs, followed by their experimental realization in high-Q silica microresonators. The impact of several nonlinear process on solitons will be discussed, which leads to novel soliton systems, e.g., Stokes solitons and counter-propagating solitons. Utilizing these nonlinear properties, we show that soliton microcombs can be adapted for high-precision spectroscopic applications. In the end, a real-time method for monitoring transient behavior of solitons will be presented.},

Also, ways to improve spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and spectral coverage are discussed. In addition to soliton microcombs, a novel spiral resonator is studied as a stable optical frequency reference. Combined with a frequency comb, this new type of chip-based reference cavity is also applied to generate stable microwaves via optical frequency division.

A new, miniature realization, the microcomb, that uses chip-based microresonators can potentially revolutionize instrumentation, time keeping, spectroscopy, and navigation. Microcombs were first demonstrated using a form of cascaded four-wave mixing. However, the recent discovery of dissipative soliton microcombs enables phase-locked spectra with reproducible envelopes, as required in many frequency comb applications. In addition, these solitons are confined in a high-Q microresonator, thereby creating a rich landscape for research in nonlinear optical phenomena. In this thesis, these solitons are demonstrated for the first time in a silica microcavity. Significantly, the device provides a microwave-detectable soliton repetition rate, which is essential to many comb applications. The unusual properties of the solitons are studied from a theoretical viewpoint using a Lagrangian formalism and predictions of the theory are confirmed experimentally. In the course of this work, a new optical soliton, the Stokes soliton, was also discovered.  In addition to soliton mode locking, another novel and compact platform, the electro-optical modulation frequency comb, was studied. This type of frequency comb was used to demonstrate a novel electro-optic form of frequency division for stable microwave synthesis. It was also modified to perform astronomical calibration for exoplanet detection at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The control of dispersion in fibre optical waveguides is of critical importance to optical fibre communications systems1,2 and more recently for continuum generation from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared3,4,5. The wavelength at which the group velocity dispersion crosses zero can be set by varying the fibre core diameter or index step2,6,7,8. Moreover, sophisticated methods to manipulate higher-order dispersion so as to shape and even flatten the dispersion over wide bandwidths are possible using multi-cladding fibres9,10,11. Here we introduce design and fabrication techniques that allow analogous dispersion control in chip-integrated optical microresonators, and thereby demonstrate higher-order, wide-bandwidth dispersion control over an octave of spectrum. Importantly, the fabrication method we employ for dispersion control simultaneously permits optical Q factors above 100 million, which is critical for the efficient operation of nonlinear optical oscillators. Dispersion control in high-Q systems has become of great importance in recent years with increased interest in chip-integrable optical frequency combs12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32.},

	abstract = {Ultrahigh-Q optical resonators are being studied across a wide range of fields, including quantum information, nonlinear optics, cavity optomechanics and telecommunications1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Here, we demonstrate a new resonator with a record Q-factor of 875 million for on-chip devices. The fabrication of our device avoids the requirement for a specialized processing step, which in microtoroid resonators8 has made it difficult to control their size and achieve millimetre- and centimetre-scale diameters. Attaining these sizes is important in applications such as microcombs and potentially also in rotation sensing. As an application of size control, stimulated Brillouin lasers incorporating our device are demonstrated. The resonators not only set a new benchmark for the Q-factor on a chip, but also provide, for the first time, full compatibility of this important device class with conventional semiconductor processing. This feature will greatly expand the range of possible ‘system on a chip’ functions enabled by ultrahigh-Q devices.},
